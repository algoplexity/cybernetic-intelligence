Rather than tools or agents, LLMs are best understood as collaborative teammates in a cybernetic system. Cybernetics, the study of systems, feedback, and control, offers a richer lens than traditional HCI or ML paradigms. In a viable system, feedback loops, context-awareness, and adaptive coordination are key. LLMs are interfaces for language-level abstraction and sense-making.

This framing is supported by empirical work such as The Cybernetic Teammate, a field study with 776 professionals at Procter & Gamble. The study found that individuals using AI performed on par with teams working without AI—suggesting that LLMs can replicate the value of certain collaborative dynamics. More importantly, AI helped participants transcend functional silos, facilitated more emotionally satisfying work, and elicited positive affect.

This isn’t automation. It’s augmentation.
