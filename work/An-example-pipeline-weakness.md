    "summary": "This excerpt highlights a significant concern regarding privacy rights in Australia, specifically concerning the availability of property data. The Attorney-Generals Department points to the Privacy Act 2022, referencing principles 12 and 13, and proposes new rights for individuals in proposals 18.1, 18.2, and 18.3. The core issue is that real estate websites like Realestate.com.au are collecting and displaying property images, potentially violating individuals\u2019 right to control their personal information and privacy."
