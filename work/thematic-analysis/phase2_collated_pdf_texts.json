Therefore, the text suggests careful consideration should be given to whether the benefits of these rights outweigh the potential strain on small businesses before removing existing exemptions."

Development of a single set of guidelines for research conducted by organisations and agencies would provide clarity about permitted purposes, and as outlined in the Privacy Act Report, facilitate entities involved in research to navigate the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information utilising the consent exception more confidently. A single set of guidelines would make collaborative research between agencies and organisations easier to navigate and improve ability for public interest research by agencies and organisation that request agency data.\nThis would likely serve to increase the scope and pace of important research. As an organisation involved in research, we are very familiar with the conservative approach to interpreting the guidelines, including determining when consent of the individual is not required under the medical research exception. 18.\n14.

This is because there are many circumstances where data processors, such as cloud services providers, wont have control or visibility over the data, or have a direct relationship with data subjects.\nMore importantly, however, it would also be inefficient for all organisations to articulate their privacy and collection practices to customers using the same, prescribed, limited terminology and icons, without flexibility particularly if these standardised documents do not accurately reflect the specific way that a particular organisation uses, or wishes to use, a customers personal information. We recommend instead that the OAIC provide principles-based guidelines, based on international standards, to assist organisations of all sizes in developing their own privacy policies and consent requests appropriate for their customers. This would give organisations the flexibility to determine how 4 best to explain their services to customers (while meeting regulatory standards), rather than including overly strict or prescriptive requirements that must be implemented in every use case."

Ordinarily, consent (which is now proposed to be voluntary, informed, current, specific and unambiguous) is required. Members note that the UK Government recently proposed the inclusion of new clauses into its privacy laws to specifically address the processing of personal data for bias monitoring, detection and correction in relation to AI systems.6 Members suggest that the AGD also considers providing legal clarity on how sensitive personal information can be used to carry out bias monitoring, detection and correction in the ADM context, particularly if discriminatory effects are likely to be one of the 'similarly significant effects' contemplated by this proposal.\nThe aforementioned matters are relevant factors to be considered in the assessment of whether a business has the capacity to comply with the obligation. Recommendation 3: Members submit that the role and duties and liability (if any) that this 'responsible person' for privacy will have in the organisation should be specified either in the Act or in supplementary guidance from the OAIC so that the compliance costs, potential conflicts of interests and other practical challenges can be properly assessed.

This must ensure that consent is facilitated through pro-privacy default options (i.e., a person must opt-in rather than opt-out), unbundled consent options (i.e., a person must explicitly opt-in for their data to be processed for marketing purposes, this cannot be captured under a forced agree to all setting), and the provision that data processing must not be made a term or condition for accessing goods or services (i.e., a person should not be forced to agree to have their information processed for marketing purposes in order to access websites, platforms, apps, or other goods or services).\nThis should ensure that risk of adverse impact or harm and the best interests of the child are minimal requirements to be considered in the processing of peoples information and these must not be offset by commercial benefits.

We think a focus on improving the quality of consents obtained is sensible in these circumstances, including the provision of guidance where consent requirements are unclear. However, we do query whether the use of the word 'unambiguous' when defining consent is in fact required, as this would appear to, in many circumstances rule out the possibility of reliance on 'implied consent' by organisations.\nCollection of such sensitive information, particularly health information, biometric data and information regarding race and ethnicity, has also increased as a result of COVID-19, diversity and inclusion initiatives and workplace verification and monitoring. (f) Our view is that: (i) further consideration should be given to whether it is practical to obtain consent in relation to the collection of all employee sensitive information or whether certain flexibility should be provided to allow employers to collect and use certain sensitive information of employees in certain limited and specific circumstances without consent; and (ii) many organisations use surveillance and other monitoring for legitimate business interests, including protection against theft, fraud or other misconduct which should be taken into account in relation to requiring compliance with all APPs. The increased prevalence of remote working due to COVID-19 has also resulted in organisations looking to new technologies including video and voice surveillance, computer activity monitoring or employee tracking to address the challenges of employees working from home.\n(d) For larger organisations we note it is expected that the privacy officer should report directly to the highest management level.5 It is unclear if that reference is intended to mean the Board of an organisation, or merely the most senior executive management level, but clarity as to this distinction is important from a governance (and ASIC) perspective. Additionally, the setup and internal processes and obligations of the business partners and managers who engage with, and/or consult the privacy officer and ask for advice when necessary would also need to be determined with OAIC guidance. From a practical perspective and most likely felt more by SME businesses - it is unlikely that every organisation will have an individual with sufficient capacity and/or knowledge to take on such a role (even where they are an existing member of staff and/or undertake other duties within the organisation), and it may be that employing a specific responsible person may be a necessary option."

The practical effect of this unambiguous requirement would be to remove opt-out inferred consent as an option which is frequently utilised within the industry.\nData analytics software is used to gain a better understanding of how websites are used, which can create a better user experience for consumers. Data collection for the purposes of data analysis may be subject to consent requirements under this Privacy by Default proposal.

Broad research consent (chapter 14) Proposal 14.1 should only extend to cases where a Human Research Ethics Committee has indicated that use of the lower standard is appropriate and necessary in the circumstances. Further Proposal 14.1 should not extend to commercial research purposes.\nIn a recent report, I provide examples of fertility apps that collect highly sensitive information concerning consumers sexual activity, reproductive health conditions, pregnancies and menstrual cycles and supposedly de-identify this information (sometimes by merely removing the consumers name and email address) and use it for vaguely described research purposes. In several cases, this use occurs by default without the opt-in consent of the consumer and sometimes with no choice to opt out.5 Relaxations of consent requirements for research should be carefully limited to avoid legitimising opportunistic appropriation of sensitive information for commercial research purposes. 4 See Joseph Turow et al, Americans Cant Consent to Companies Use of their Data (Report, February 2023).\nConsent (chapter 11) Proposal 11.1 is supported with amendments. Consent should be defined as voluntary, informed, current, specific, and an unambiguous indication through clear action, as originally proposed in the Discussion Paper. For the reasons explained in respect of the need for opt-in consent in chapter 20 below, consent should require clear action and supply of a service should not be conditional upon the individual providing consent for extra purposes."

If a direct right of action is introduced, it is important that it be appropriately limited by causation and harm and that there be a limit on class actions. It should also be considered how introducing an individual right of action should be coordinated with the other proposed changes to the Privacy Act (including the removal of the small business exemption) to avoid introducing unnecessary regulatory risk for businesses adapting to a new suite of privacy laws or for small businesses adapting to coverage under the Privacy Act for the first time.\n3.

A preferable approach is to strengthen the resources of the OAIC to deal with privacy issues under the existing complaints framework.\n25 breach finding and meaningful remedies for complainants.41 It is clear that the complaints mechanism is operating correctly, with individuals being able to seek remedies for interferences with privacy, and increasing the OAIC's resources to deal with those complaints would have a positive outcome. This is a desirable outcome that serves the public interest in a more effective way than a new right of action, which will lead to drawn-out and costly litigation. Similar to the proposed tort, the direct right of action is also inconsistent with other areas of recent law reform which aim to reduce the amount of litigation in Australian courts and limit the amount of damages being awarded."

Legal or similarly significant effects as addressed by Article 22 are assessed in the European Union and United Kingdom in a context of legally enforceable human rights which do not have a directly enforceable, rights-based analogy under Australian law. In that context, in Australia substantially automated decisions which have a legal or similarly significant effect on an individuals rights is an indeterminate class of both decisions (what does substantially automated mean?)\nIn that context, in Australia substantially automated decisions which have a legal or similarly significant effect on an individuals rights is an indeterminate class of both decisions (what does substantially automated mean?) and rights (rights in and to privacy, or other rights?). Further, the current intensive activity within the EU to develop and enact an AI Act is indicative of the limited utility of Article 22 of the EU GDPR in addressing reliability and reliance upon AI/ML and advanced analytics in ADM."

It suggests that fostering a digital environment free from manipulative algorithmic influence \u2013 even if that means a lack of algorithmic transparency \u2013 is more important for safeguarding democracy. Ultimately, strong privacy protections are needed to counter the negative impacts of these systems on public discourse and participation."
