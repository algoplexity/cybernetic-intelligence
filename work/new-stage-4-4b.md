Okay, based on our refined understanding, the "code that does exactly the above" right now consists of **three main Python script components** that you would run sequentially. You already have the code for the first two (Original Stage 4 and Stage 4a), and we've outlined the third ("New Stage 4 / Stage 4b").

Let's break down what the code for each phase looks like conceptually, referencing the scripts you've provided or we've discussed:

**Phase 1: PDF-Centric Content Extraction (Your Original Stage 4)**

*   **Script:** This is your `unstructured_text_response_centric_uds_v2_py.txt` file, specifically the main execution block and helper functions that constitute your "Stage 4: PDF Content Analysis (Retrieval & Selective Summarization)."
*   **Key Logic (What it does):**
    *   Loads models (Embedding model like MiniLM, Summarization LLM like Gemma).
    *   Loads `processed_responses.jsonl` (ideally in a way that allows iteration without loading all into memory if it's huge, or it processes this file in chunks based on your `MAX_RUNTIME_MINUTES` and `STATE_FILE`).
    *   **Outer Loop:** Iterates through each `response_object` from `processed_responses.jsonl`.
        *   Checks `STATE_FILE` to skip already processed `response_id`s.
        *   Extracts `pdf_text`.
        *   If `pdf_text` is valid:
            *   Cleans and tokenizes PDF text into `sentences`.
            *   Generates `sentence_embeddings` for all sentences in *this PDF* (using `get_local_embeddings`).
            *   **Inner Loop:** For each `qid` in `target_qids`:
                *   Gets `q_embedding` for the current `qid`.
                *   Calls `retrieve_relevant_passages` to find passages from the current PDF relevant to the current QID.
                *   If passages are found and `QUESTIONS_TO_SUMMARIZE` allows, calls `summarize_context_block` to generate a summary *of these specific passages for this QID from this response*.
                *   Stores the `extracted_passages` and/or `summary` in a nested dictionary under the current `response_id` and `qid`.
    *   **Output Saving:** Periodically (based on `SAVE_STATE_INTERVAL_SECONDS` or after processing a chunk of `processed_responses.jsonl` if you run it on subsets) saves the `results` dictionary (which is `{"response_id": { "QID": {"summary": ..., "passages": ...}}}`) to a JSON file. This results in your `pdf_passage_analysis_by_response_minilm_gemmaN.json` files.
    *   Updates `STATE_FILE` with processed `response_id`s.
*   **Current State:** You need to ensure this script is run (or re-run with its resume capability) until **ALL ~485 responses** (or all desired responses with PDFs) from `processed_responses.jsonl` have been processed by it. The output will be a *complete set* of `...gemmaN.json` files.

**Phase 2: Question-Centric Collation (Your Stage 4a)**

*   **Script:** This is the script we developed and you successfully ran, which produced `stage4a_text_collation_log.txt` and the output `stage4a_collated_texts_for_thematic_analysis_20250515_060005.json`. I provided this script in a previous message (titled something like "Script to extract relevant summaries... JSON output").
*   **Key Logic (What it does):**
    *   Takes a directory path containing all the output JSON files from Phase 1 (your `...gemmaN.json` files).
    *   Initializes `qid_collected_content = defaultdict(list)`.
    *   **Outer Loop:** Iterates through each `...gemmaN.json` file.
        *   Loads the file.
        *   **Inner Loop 1:** Iterates through each `response_id` in that file.
            *   **Inner Loop 2:** Iterates through each `qid` for that `response_id`.
                *   Extracts the `"summary"` (if valid and non-blank) or the `"extracted_passages"`.
                *   Appends this text (along with metadata like `response_id`, `source_file`, `type`) to `qid_collected_content[qid]`.
    *   Saves `qid_collected_content` (along with metadata) to a single output JSON file (e.g., `stage4a_collated_texts_for_thematic_analysis_COMPLETE.json`).
*   **Current State:** You have successfully run this for a *partial* set of Phase 1 outputs (33 files covering 388 responses). You will re-run this script once Phase 1 is complete for *all* responses, pointing it to the directory containing the *complete set* of Phase 1 output files.

**Phase 3: Question-Centric LLM Thematic Analysis (Your "New Stage 4 / Stage 4b")**

*   **Script:** This is the script we conceptualized and for which I provided a detailed outline in the message starting with "Yes, absolutely! We can definitely reuse and adapt parts of your existing code..." and then refined with the "New Stage 4: Question-Centric PDF Thematic Summarization" outline.
*   **Key Logic (What it does):**
    *   Loads the LLM and tokenizer (e.g., Gemma).
    *   Loads the **complete** `stage4a_collated_texts_for_thematic_analysis_COMPLETE.json` (output from Phase 2).
    *   Loads question texts (e.g., from `template_questions` or `CAR_35`).
    *   Initializes `overall_q_analysis_results = {}` (and loads existing results if resuming).
    *   **Outer Loop: Iterates QID by QID.**
        *   If QID already processed in `overall_q_analysis_results`, skip.
        *   Retrieve all collated texts for the current `QID` from the loaded Stage 4a data.
        *   Combine these texts into `final_text_chunk_for_llm`.
        *   **Implement Context Window Management (Map-Reduce for Themes):**
            *   Estimate tokens in `final_text_chunk_for_llm`.
            *   If `final_text_chunk_for_llm` is too large for a single LLM call:
                *   **Map Step:** Split `final_text_chunk_for_llm` into smaller `sub_chunks`. For each `sub_chunk`, use an LLM prompt to extract key ideas/points *from that sub_chunk* related to the current QID.
                *   Collect all these key ideas/points from all `sub_chunks`.
                *   **Reduce Step:** Feed the *collection of key ideas/points* to the LLM with a prompt to synthesize them into the "Top 3 common distinct themes/points" for the overall QID, with labels and explanations.
            *   Else (if `final_text_chunk_for_llm` fits):
                *   Directly feed `final_text_chunk_for_llm` to the LLM with the "Top 3 common distinct themes/points" prompt.
        *   Parse the LLM's textual output to extract the structured themes (e.g., `[{"theme_label": "...", "explanation": "..."}, ...]`).
        *   Store this thematic analysis result for the current QID in `overall_q_analysis_results`.
        *   **Save `overall_q_analysis_results` to a JSON file immediately after processing each QID** to ensure robustness.
    *   **Output:** A final JSON file (e.g., `stage4b_pdf_thematic_points_COMPLETE.json`) containing the top themes for each QID.
*   **Current State:** We have a detailed conceptual outline and a starting Python structure for this. The most complex parts to implement fully are the **map-reduce logic for LLM context window management** and the **robust parsing of the LLM's thematic output.**

**In summary:**

*   **Phase 1 Code:** Your existing `unstructured_text_response_centric_uds_v2_py.txt` (Original Stage 4). **Action: Ensure it runs to completion for all ~485 responses.**
*   **Phase 2 Code:** The script for Stage 4a (collating Stage 4 outputs per QID). You have this and it works. **Action: Re-run it on the *complete* output of Phase 1.**
*   **Phase 3 Code:** The script for "New Stage 4 / Stage 4b" (LLM thematic analysis per QID). We have a strong conceptual outline and a Python skeleton. **Action: Flesh out the LLM call, context window management (map-reduce), and LLM output parsing logic.**

This provides a clear, phased approach. The code for Phase 1 and 2 is largely in place. Phase 3 is the next major development piece.
