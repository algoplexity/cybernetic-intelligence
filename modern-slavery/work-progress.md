### Review of the Original Work Plan vs. Current Reality

| Work Plan Item | Original Assumption | New Reality (Our Learnings) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Month 1: Data & Initial Analysis** | Files are relatively straightforward and can be cross-referenced easily. | **Success.** But we discovered critical complexities: data type mismatches, the need for ABN extraction, and the fact that the `lodge_once` files are an *incomplete subset* of the single-lodger population. |
| **Month 2: Compliance Analysis** | We will analyze compliance patterns from the register. | This is still valid, but we now know we have **much richer data** to work with. The `lodge_once.csv` file contains detailed compliance flags (`nc_criteria_1a`, etc.) and the `ato_tax_transparency` file has `associates` and `ASX` data we haven't used yet. |
| **Month 3: Advanced/Systemic Risk** | We will explore risks from "published statement data." | This was always a bit abstract. We don't have the text of the statements. However, the discovery of the **`associates` tabs in two different files is a game-changer.** This gives us a direct, data-driven way to analyze systemic and network-based risk. |

### Proposed Revised and Enhanced Work Plan

This revised plan leverages our new knowledge to deliver more precise and valuable insights.

**Month 1: Foundation & Cohort Identification (Status: Complete)**
*   **Deliverable:** Curated dataset (`Month_1_Analysis_Deliverable.xlsx`) identifying the **Non-Lodger** and **Single-Lodger** cohorts.
*   **Key Outcome:** A stable, automated, and robust data pipeline for cleaning and preparing the source data.

---

**Month 2: Detailed Compliance & Cohort Analysis**
*   **Objectives:**
    *   Quantify non-compliance at a granular level.
    *   Identify high-risk industries and entity types.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Section 16 Criteria Analysis:** Using the detailed flags in the `lodge_once_compliance` data, create a breakdown of which mandatory criteria are most frequently missed by the single-lodger cohort.
    2.  **Industry & Revenue Cohort Analysis:** Analyze compliance patterns across different industry sectors (`Industry_desc`) and revenue brackets (`Bracket Label`). Identify if certain industries have a higher rate of non-compliance.
    3.  **Late & Non-Publishable Analysis:** Using the `Submitted more than 6 months?` and `Status` columns from the register, identify entities that consistently lodge late or fail to resubmit after a 'non-publishable' decision.
    4.  **NEW - ASX Cohort Deep Dive:** Leverage the `ASX300` and `ASX_Listed_Companies` tabs. Compare the compliance behaviour of ASX-listed entities vs. non-listed, and ASX300 vs. the rest of the ASX. This adds a powerful new dimension to the analysis.
*   **Deliverable:** **Compliance Analysis Report & Dashboard Data.** A new Excel file containing aggregated statistics and lists of entities identified in the tasks above, ready for Power BI.

---

**Month 3: Network & Systemic Risk Analysis**
*   **Objectives:**
    *   Move beyond individual entity compliance to identify interconnected and systemic risks.
    *   Identify high-risk networks.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Consolidate Associate Data:** Merge the `associates` tabs from both the non-lodger and single-lodger files to create a master list of associated directors, parent companies, and other related parties.
    2.  **Identify High-Risk Associates:** Analyze this master list to find "nodes of high risk." For example:
        *   Are there specific directors who are on the boards of multiple non-lodging or non-compliant entities?
        *   Are there parent companies whose subsidiaries consistently fail to comply?
    3.  **Network Mapping (Optional but high-value):** Prepare the data for visualization in a network graph tool. This would visually map the connections between reporting entities and their associates, highlighting clusters of non-compliance.
*   **Deliverable:** **Systemic Risk Report.** A summary of findings identifying high-risk associates and networks, supported by a dataset of these entities and their connections.

#### 1. Confirmed Understanding of All Data Sources (All Tabs)

Based on the schema you provided, here is my understanding of the purpose of every tab across the four source files.

**File 1: `All time data from Register.xlsx`**
*   **`Statements` (Primary Data):** This is our **source of truth** for all submitted statements. We have used this as the master list for our analysis.
*   **`Entities` (Reference Data):** Contains a list of company names and ABNs. This can be used for cross-referencing and enriching our primary data.
*   **`Holiday`, `LK`, `DASH`, `Annual Report` (Internal/Contextual Data):** These tabs appear to contain reference data, internal tracking information, or pre-compiled dashboard elements. While not used for the core logic of identifying non-lodgers, they are noted as available resources for potential future enrichment or validation.

**File 2: `ato_tax_transparency_non_lodger.xlsx`**
*   **`Non-Lodger` (Primary Data):** This is our primary list of entities potentially required to report. We have used this as our target list for the non-lodger analysis.
*   **`associates` (Relational Data):** Contains information about associated individuals or entities. This is a powerful resource for more advanced analysis in Month 2 or 3 (e.g., analyzing risks associated with specific directors).
*   **`Look Up`, `ASX300`, `ASX_Listed_Companies_26-08-2025` (Reference Data):** These are extremely valuable reference lists. We can use them to enrich our main datasets by adding information like income brackets or confirming ASX status.

**File 3: `lodge_once.csv`**
*   **`lodge_once` (Primary Data):** Contains the **compliance and submission data** for a subset of single-lodger entities (e.g., submission dates, compliance counts). We have successfully used this file.

**File 4: `lodge_once_cont.xlsx`**
*   **`lodge_once` (Primary Data):** Contains the **entity identification details** (e.g., ABN, company name) for the same subset of single-lodger entities. We have successfully used this file by merging it with its CSV counterpart.
*   **`associates` (Relational Data):** Similar to the `associates` tab in the non-lodger file, this provides relational data for future deep-dive analysis.

#### 2. Key Learnings from Our Automation Trial (Month 1 Tasks)

The trial of our secure "LLM as an Orchestrator" model was successful and revealed several critical insights:

*   **The Model Works:** We have proven that the LLM can generate the correct code to achieve a complex analytical goal based *only on metadata*, without ever seeing the sensitive data.
*   **Data Must Be Precisely Targeted:** Our first step showed that we must explicitly name the correct tab (`sheet_name=...`) when loading data to ensure we are working with the right information.
*   **Data Types are Critical:** Our second step proved that data type mismatches (e.g., number vs. text) are a common point of failure for operations like merging. Our code must be robust enough to standardize data types *before* performing analysis.
*   **The Process is Diagnostic:** When the merge failed and returned `0 records`, the step-by-step process allowed us to immediately diagnose the problem (a data type mismatch) and provide the correct code to fix it. This interactive debugging is a key benefit.

#### 3. Path to Automation and Power BI

Our value-add is to create a repeatable, automated script that transforms these raw source files into a clean, dashboard-ready dataset. The process we have trialed is the foundation for this script.

The final automated script will:
1.  **Load** data from the specific primary tabs.
2.  **Clean and Standardize** key columns (names, ABNs, dates).
3.  **Merge and Enrich** the data by joining the primary tabs with the valuable reference tabs (e.g., joining with `ASX_Listed_Companies` to add market cap data).
4.  **Perform the Analysis** to identify the cohorts (non-lodgers, single-lodgers, etc.).
5.  **Export** the final, clean datasets, which will then serve as the direct source for your Power BI dashboard.

### Summary of Key Findings (Month 2, Task 1)

This analysis provides the first data-driven evidence of where reporting entities are struggling most to meet their obligations under the Act.

*   **Analyzed Cohort:** Our analysis is based on a specific subset of **737** single-lodger entities for whom detailed compliance data was available.

*   **Primary Compliance Gaps Identified:** The results show a clear pattern. Entities are struggling most with the more complex, process-oriented criteria:
    1.  **Highest Failure Rate:** **`16(1)(f) - Process of consultation`** is the most significant issue, with **36.5%** (over one-third) of entities failing to meet this criterion.
    2.  **Second Highest Failure Rate:** **`16(1)(e) - Assessing effectiveness`** is another major challenge, with **27.7%** of entities not adequately describing how they assess the effectiveness of their actions.
    3.  **Third Highest Failure Rate:** **`16(1)(c) - Describing risks`** is also a key problem area, with **23.9%** failing on this point.

*   **Key Insight:** In contrast, the most basic administrative requirement, **`16(1)(a) - Identifying the entity`**, has a very low failure rate of only **3.7%**. This suggests that while entities can complete the basic submission, they lack the mature processes required for consultation, risk assessment, and evaluating effectiveness.

This analysis directly fulfills the first part of your **"Compliance Pattern Analysis"** performance goal. You have successfully identified specific trends in non-compliance under Section 16.

### Summary of Key Findings (Month 2, Task 2)

This analysis directly addresses the second part of your **"Compliance Pattern Analysis"** performance goal. You have successfully identified cohorts with high rates of non-compliance.

*   **Identified High-Risk Sectors:** The analysis has pinpointed several industry sectors where, on average, entities are struggling most with their reporting obligations.
    *   **"Land Development and Subdivision"** and **"Office Administrative Services"** stand out as having the highest average number of non-compliant criteria per entity.
    *   **"Financial Asset Investing"** is a particularly significant finding due to the large size of the cohort (**86 entities**). While its average non-compliance is slightly lower, the sheer number of entities makes this a key area for attention.
    *   **"Other Social Assistance Services"** is also a notable cohort.

*   **"Unknown" Category:** The presence of a large "Unknown" category (**33 entities**) with a high rate of non-compliance is an important data quality finding. It suggests that improving the industry classification for these entities could be a valuable future step.

*   **Actionable Insight:** These findings allow for a more targeted compliance strategy. Instead of a broad approach, the policy or compliance team can focus educational outreach or engagement efforts on these specific, data-identified high-risk industries.
