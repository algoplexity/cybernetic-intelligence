### Review of the Original Work Plan vs. Current Reality

| Work Plan Item | Original Assumption | New Reality (Our Learnings) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Month 1: Data & Initial Analysis** | Files are relatively straightforward and can be cross-referenced easily. | **Success.** But we discovered critical complexities: data type mismatches, the need for ABN extraction, and the fact that the `lodge_once` files are an *incomplete subset* of the single-lodger population. |
| **Month 2: Compliance Analysis** | We will analyze compliance patterns from the register. | This is still valid, but we now know we have **much richer data** to work with. The `lodge_once.csv` file contains detailed compliance flags (`nc_criteria_1a`, etc.) and the `ato_tax_transparency` file has `associates` and `ASX` data we haven't used yet. |
| **Month 3: Advanced/Systemic Risk** | We will explore risks from "published statement data." | This was always a bit abstract. We don't have the text of the statements. However, the discovery of the **`associates` tabs in two different files is a game-changer.** This gives us a direct, data-driven way to analyze systemic and network-based risk. |

### Proposed Revised and Enhanced Work Plan

This revised plan leverages our new knowledge to deliver more precise and valuable insights.

**Month 1: Foundation & Cohort Identification (Status: Complete)**
*   **Deliverable:** Curated dataset (`Month_1_Analysis_Deliverable.xlsx`) identifying the **Non-Lodger** and **Single-Lodger** cohorts.
*   **Key Outcome:** A stable, automated, and robust data pipeline for cleaning and preparing the source data.

**Month 2: Detailed Compliance & Cohort Analysis**
*   **Objectives:**
    *   Quantify non-compliance at a granular level.
    *   Identify high-risk industries and entity types.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Section 16 Criteria Analysis:** Using the detailed flags in the `lodge_once_compliance` data, create a breakdown of which mandatory criteria are most frequently missed by the single-lodger cohort.
    2.  **Industry & Revenue Cohort Analysis:** Analyze compliance patterns across different industry sectors (`Industry_desc`) and revenue brackets (`Bracket Label`). Identify if certain industries have a higher rate of non-compliance.
    3.  **Late & Non-Publishable Analysis:** Using the `Submitted more than 6 months?` and `Status` columns from the register, identify entities that consistently lodge late or fail to resubmit after a 'non-publishable' decision.
    4.  **NEW - ASX Cohort Deep Dive:** Leverage the `ASX300` and `ASX_Listed_Companies` tabs. Compare the compliance behaviour of ASX-listed entities vs. non-listed, and ASX300 vs. the rest of the ASX. This adds a powerful new dimension to the analysis.
*   **Deliverable:** **Compliance Analysis Report & Dashboard Data.** A new Excel file containing aggregated statistics and lists of entities identified in the tasks above, ready for Power BI.

**Month 3: Network & Systemic Risk Analysis**
*   **Objectives:**
    *   Move beyond individual entity compliance to identify interconnected and systemic risks.
    *   Identify high-risk networks.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Consolidate Associate Data:** Merge the `associates` tabs from both the non-lodger and single-lodger files to create a master list of associated directors, parent companies, and other related parties.
    2.  **Identify High-Risk Associates:** Analyze this master list to find "nodes of high risk." For example:
        *   Are there specific directors who are on the boards of multiple non-lodging or non-compliant entities?
        *   Are there parent companies whose subsidiaries consistently fail to comply?
    3.  **Network Mapping (Optional but high-value):** Prepare the data for visualization in a network graph tool. This would visually map the connections between reporting entities and their associates, highlighting clusters of non-compliance.
*   **Deliverable:** **Systemic Risk Report.** A summary of findings identifying high-risk associates and networks, supported by a dataset of these entities and their connections.

#### 1. Confirmed Understanding of All Data Sources (All Tabs)

Based on the schema you provided, here is my understanding of the purpose of every tab across the four source files.

**File 1: `All time data from Register.xlsx`**
*   **`Statements` (Primary Data):** This is our **source of truth** for all submitted statements. We have used this as the master list for our analysis.
*   **`Entities` (Reference Data):** Contains a list of company names and ABNs. This can be used for cross-referencing and enriching our primary data.
*   **`Holiday`, `LK`, `DASH`, `Annual Report` (Internal/Contextual Data):** These tabs appear to contain reference data, internal tracking information, or pre-compiled dashboard elements. While not used for the core logic of identifying non-lodgers, they are noted as available resources for potential future enrichment or validation.

**File 2: `ato_tax_transparency_non_lodger.xlsx`**
*   **`Non-Lodger` (Primary Data):** This is our primary list of entities potentially required to report. We have used this as our target list for the non-lodger analysis.
*   **`associates` (Relational Data):** Contains information about associated individuals or entities. This is a powerful resource for more advanced analysis in Month 2 or 3 (e.g., analyzing risks associated with specific directors).
*   **`Look Up`, `ASX300`, `ASX_Listed_Companies_26-08-2025` (Reference Data):** These are extremely valuable reference lists. We can use them to enrich our main datasets by adding information like income brackets or confirming ASX status.

**File 3: `lodge_once.csv`**
*   **`lodge_once` (Primary Data):** Contains the **compliance and submission data** for a subset of single-lodger entities (e.g., submission dates, compliance counts). We have successfully used this file.

**File 4: `lodge_once_cont.xlsx`**
*   **`lodge_once` (Primary Data):** Contains the **entity identification details** (e.g., ABN, company name) for the same subset of single-lodger entities. We have successfully used this file by merging it with its CSV counterpart.
*   **`associates` (Relational Data):** Similar to the `associates` tab in the non-lodger file, this provides relational data for future deep-dive analysis.

#### 2. Key Learnings from Our Automation Trial (Month 1 Tasks)

The trial of our secure "LLM as an Orchestrator" model was successful and revealed several critical insights:

*   **The Model Works:** We have proven that the LLM can generate the correct code to achieve a complex analytical goal based *only on metadata*, without ever seeing the sensitive data.
*   **Data Must Be Precisely Targeted:** Our first step showed that we must explicitly name the correct tab (`sheet_name=...`) when loading data to ensure we are working with the right information.
*   **Data Types are Critical:** Our second step proved that data type mismatches (e.g., number vs. text) are a common point of failure for operations like merging. Our code must be robust enough to standardize data types *before* performing analysis.
*   **The Process is Diagnostic:** When the merge failed and returned `0 records`, the step-by-step process allowed us to immediately diagnose the problem (a data type mismatch) and provide the correct code to fix it. This interactive debugging is a key benefit.

#### 3. Path to Automation and Power BI

Our value-add is to create a repeatable, automated script that transforms these raw source files into a clean, dashboard-ready dataset. The process we have trialed is the foundation for this script.

The final automated script will:
1.  **Load** data from the specific primary tabs.
2.  **Clean and Standardize** key columns (names, ABNs, dates).
3.  **Merge and Enrich** the data by joining the primary tabs with the valuable reference tabs (e.g., joining with `ASX_Listed_Companies` to add market cap data).
4.  **Perform the Analysis** to identify the cohorts (non-lodgers, single-lodgers, etc.).
5.  **Export** the final, clean datasets, which will then serve as the direct source for your Power BI dashboard.
