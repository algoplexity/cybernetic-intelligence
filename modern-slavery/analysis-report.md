### **Definitive Report: A Multi-faceted Analysis of Modern Slavery Act Compliance Behaviour**

**Executive summary**

This report provides a conclusive, multi-faceted analysis of compliance behaviour under the *Modern Slavery Act 2018*. This analysis is the culmination of a comprehensive data engineering project that integrated multiple authoritative sources into a single, verified Master Behavioural File.

Our analysis focused on comparing the compliance patterns of legally mandated entities against those who report voluntarily. This has revealed clear and significant differences in behaviour.

**Primary finding**

The data shows a stark behavioural divide between mandated and proactive reporters. The "Newly Visible Segment" of newly obligated private companies demonstrates a critical lack of engagement, with **73.3% completely ignoring the Act**. This is in direct contrast to "Voluntary Reporters", **99.9%** of whom successfully publish a statement.

This finding strongly suggests that the primary challenge for the Regulator is not one of reporting capability, but of awareness and engagement among specific, legally obligated cohorts. It provides a clear mandate for a highly targeted compliance strategy.

**1. Our analytical framework**

Our analysis moved beyond a simple compliant/non-compliant binary. We classified every entity for every year into one of four distinct behavioural categories: `Compliant (Published)`, `Attempted (Redraft)`, `Initiated (Draft)`, and `Ignored (No Action)`.

This allowed us to compare not just the outcomes, but the underlying behavioural patterns of different segments of the business community.

**2. Key findings in detail**

The final results provide clear, actionable intelligence by contrasting the behaviour of mandated entities with those who are intrinsically motivated.

**Finding 1: A stark behavioural divide exists between mandated and voluntary reporters.**
The most powerful insight comes from comparing the behaviour of the legally mandated "Newly Visible Segment" with that of the proactive "Voluntary Reporter" segment.

*   **Newly Visible (Mandated):** An overwhelming **73.3%** of this group **Ignored** the Act, taking no action. Only **24.1%** were fully compliant.
*   **Voluntary Reporters:** In contrast, **99.9%** of this group successfully reached the **Compliant (Published)** status. Critically, **0.0%** of this proactive group ignored their intent to report.

This stark difference suggests that intrinsic motivation is a far more powerful driver of compliance success than legal obligation alone.

**Finding 2: The "attempted but failed" rate is consistently very low.**
Across all cohorts—mandated and voluntary—the percentage of entities who get "stuck" in the `Draft` or `Redraft` phase is extremely small (typically less than 2%). This confirms that the primary driver of non-compliance is a failure to even begin the process, reinforcing the conclusion that the core problem is one of engagement, not capability.

**Finding 3: The non-compliant cohort is specific and targetable.**
Our broader comparative analysis confirmed that the high rate of non-compliance is heavily concentrated in the "Newly Visible Segment" of private companies. Their compliance behaviour is a significant outlier when compared to their public and foreign-owned peers (who are 71.3% compliant) and the broader corporate landscape (85.0% compliant).

**3. Conclusions and actionable intelligence**

This comprehensive analysis provides a clear path forward for the Regulator.

**The problem is engagement, not capability.**
The data strongly suggests that the primary barrier to compliance for the newly identified cohort of private companies is a lack of awareness or a failure to begin the process. The high success rate of voluntary reporters proves that the reporting system itself is not a significant barrier for those who choose to engage.

**A targeted strategy is essential.**
A one-size-fits-all compliance strategy is unlikely to be effective. The evidence clearly points to a need for a specific, direct outreach and education campaign aimed at the **2,431** entities we have identified in the "Ignored (No Action)" category within the Newly Visible Segment.

The foundational dataset and the actionable lists produced by this project provide the definitive, evidence-based tools required to execute this targeted strategy immediately. This concludes the data analysis phase of our project.
