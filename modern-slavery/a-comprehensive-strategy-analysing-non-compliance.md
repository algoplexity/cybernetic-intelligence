### **White Paper: A Comprehensive Strategy for Analysing Modern Slavery Act Non-Compliance**

**Purpose**

This document outlines the definitive strategy for the analytical phase of our Modern Slavery Act compliance project. This phase will leverage the foundational datasets we have successfully built and verified.

The objective of this work is to move beyond the simple identification of non-lodgers to a deep, multi-faceted analysis of their characteristics and behaviour. The insights generated will provide clear, actionable intelligence to the Regulator, enabling the development of a targeted and evidence-based compliance strategy.

**1. Our foundational assets**

This analysis is built upon a high-confidence, integrated data foundation. Our data engineering phase has produced three distinct and verified "universes" of data, which have been consolidated into a single, authoritative **Master Behavioural File**.

| Foundational universe | Purpose | Key data source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Universe of Identity** | To create a master link between all business names and their official, verified ABN/ACN. | ABR Bulk Extract, ASIC Business Names Register |
| **The Universe of Obligation** | To create a definitive, year-by-year list of all corporate and charitable entities with a confirmed legal reporting obligation. | ATO Corporate Tax Transparency reports, ACNC Charity Register, ASIC Company Register |
| **The Universe of Action** | To create a complete, year-by-year log of every action (Published, Draft, Redraft) taken by every entity in the Modern Slavery Register. | Modern Slavery Statements Register |

**2. Our analytical framework: the four categories of compliance behaviour**

Our analysis is oriented around a clear classification framework. For each year an entity has a legal obligation, we have classified its behaviour into one of four distinct categories:

1.  **Compliant (Published):** The entity fulfilled its legal obligation.
2.  **Attempted (Redraft):** The entity acknowledged its obligation but failed to meet the required standard.
3.  **Initiated (Draft):** The entity began the process but failed to complete its legal obligation.
4.  **Ignored (No Action):** The entity took no visible action to comply.

This framework allows us to move beyond a simple "lodger vs. non-lodger" binary to a more nuanced understanding of compliance maturity and intent.

**3. The analytical work plan: a multi-faceted comparative analysis**

Our analysis will be structured as a comprehensive comparative study. We will first establish a deep profile of our key cohort of interest—the "Newly Visible Segment"—and then benchmark its behaviour against other crucial segments of the economy.

**Phase 1: A deep-dive profile of the "Newly Visible Segment"**
Our first step is to analyse the cohort of Australian-owned private companies with revenues between $100 million and $200 million who became authoritatively identifiable in 2022–23.

*   **Analysis:** We will produce a detailed breakdown of this cohort, showing the percentage that falls into each of the four behavioural categories for their first year of clear obligation.
*   **Insight:** This will provide a complete picture of this group’s initial compliance behaviour.

**Phase 2: A comprehensive, four-part comparative analysis**
Next, we will put the findings from Phase 1 into context by benchmarking the behaviour of the "Newly Visible Segment" against four distinct cohorts.

For each of the "slices" below, we will compare the full, four-category behavioural breakdown.

| Comparison slice | Cohort definition | Key analytical question |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Slice A: Direct Peers** | All public and foreign-owned companies in the same revenue bracket ($100M-$200M) and the same year. | Is the compliance behaviour of private companies different from their public and foreign-owned peers of the same size? |
| **Slice B: Overall Corporate Benchmark** | All other obligated company types, regardless of revenue, for the same year. | How does this segment’s behaviour compare to the entire obligated corporate landscape in the most recent period? |
| **Slice C: Historical Benchmark** | The original cohort of all entities that first became obligated in 2019. | Has "first-year" compliance behaviour changed since the Act was introduced? |
| **Slice D: Proactive Benchmark** | The cohort of all entities classified as "Voluntary Reporters." | How does the behaviour of legally mandated entities compare to that of entities who are intrinsically motivated to report? |

**4. The final output: actionable intelligence for the Regulator**

This comprehensive analytical strategy will deliver a level of insight that is both deep and broad. The final report will not only identify *who* is non-compliant but will provide a clear, evidence-based narrative about *how* and *why* different segments are failing to comply.

The outputs will include:
*   A definitive, clean list of non-lodging entities, segmented by their behavioural patterns.
*   A series of clear visualisations (such as stacked bar charts) to illustrate the different compliance profiles of each cohort.
*   A set of clear, actionable conclusions to inform the Regulator’s engagement strategy.

This work will provide an unprecedented, intelligence-led foundation for the effective and targeted administration of the Modern Slavery Act.
