**Subject: Project Update: Modern Slavery Act Compliance Patterns & Risk Insights (Month 2 Findings)**

**To:** Project Stakeholders
**From:** [Your Name]

**1. Executive Summary**

This report details the successful completion of the Month 2 **Compliance Pattern Analysis** for the Modern Slavery Act project. Building on the foundational cohorts identified in Month 1, this phase focused on analyzing the behavior of the **4,198 single-lodgement entities** to identify specific trends and risks.

Our analysis has produced several critical, evidence-based insights that are directly actionable for policy and compliance teams:

*   **Late Submission is a Major Issue:** A definitive, manually-recalculated analysis reveals that **28.4% (1,191 entities)** of this cohort submitted their statements late. This is a significant compliance gap.
*   **Specific Criteria are Consistently Missed:** Entities are not failing equally across all requirements. They struggle most with process-oriented criteria, specifically **Process of Consultation (36.5% failure rate)** and **Assessing Effectiveness (27.7% failure rate)**.
*   **High-Risk Industries Identified:** The analysis has pinpointed several industry sectors with the highest average rates of non-compliance, including **"Land Development and Subdivision," "Office Administrative Services,"** and the large **"Financial Asset Investing"** cohort.
*   **ASX Listing Correlates with Better Compliance:** Within our analyzed cohort, ASX-listed entities demonstrated a lower average rate of non-compliance compared to their non-listed counterparts, suggesting public accountability may influence reporting quality.

These findings provide a data-driven foundation for targeted compliance engagement, educational outreach, and future policy considerations.

**2. Detailed Methodology & Findings**

The insights above were derived from a multi-stage analysis of the single-lodger cohort, using the curated dataset produced in Month 1. The following steps were taken:

**a) Section 16 Criteria Analysis**
*   **Process:** We analyzed the detailed compliance flag columns (`nc_criteria_1a` through `1f`) for the subset of 737 entities for which this data was available. The script calculated the total count and percentage of entities that failed to meet each mandatory criterion.
*   **Finding:** This quantified the precise areas of weakness in reporting, highlighting that entities struggle most with describing their consultation processes and how they assess the effectiveness of their actions against modern slavery risks.

**b) High-Risk Industry Identification**
*   **Process:** We grouped the 737 entities by their ABR industry description (`industry_desc`) and calculated the average number of non-compliant criteria for each sector. To ensure statistical significance, we focused on industries with five or more reporting entities.
*   **Finding:** This produced a ranked list of high-risk sectors, allowing for a more targeted approach to compliance and engagement efforts.

**c) ASX Status Comparison**
*   **Process:** The single-lodger dataset was enriched by cross-referencing it with master lists of ASX-listed and ASX300 companies. We then grouped the entities into two cohorts (Listed vs. Not Listed) and calculated the average non-compliance rate for each.
*   **Finding:** This analysis revealed a clear trend of better compliance among publicly listed companies within this dataset.

**d) Submission Timeliness & Outcome Validation**
*   **Process:** Initial analysis of pre-calculated flags showed a suspicious zero-count for late submissions. To ensure accuracy, we performed a definitive validation.
    1.  **Manual Recalculation:** We ignored the unreliable flag and instead used the primary timestamp data (`Period end date` and `Submitted` date) to manually calculate whether each of the 4,198 statements was submitted after the six-month deadline.
    2.  **Status Analysis:** We analyzed the raw `Status` column to identify the actual submission outcomes.
*   **Finding:** This rigorous validation overturned the initial result, proving that late submission is a significant issue (**28.4%**). It also showed that a notable portion of statements (**19.8%**) remain in a non-final state (`Draft`, `Redraft`, `Hidden`).

**3. Next Steps**

With this comprehensive compliance picture now complete, the project is perfectly positioned to proceed to **Month 3: Systemic Risk Analysis**. This will address the optional stretch goal in my performance plan.

The next phase will involve analyzing the **`associates` data** to identify interconnected risks, such as directors or parent companies linked to multiple non-compliant entities. This will shift our focus from individual entity behavior to the broader network of systemic risk.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss these findings in more detail.

Best regards,
