### **Architectural Approach: Thematic Analysis with GNN-RAG**

The goal is no longer to answer a simple question but to synthesize insights from a large corpus of documents (all the statements on the register). Hereâ€™s how the GNN-RAG architecture is adapted for this task:

1.  **Corpus Ingestion & Knowledge Graph Construction:**
    *   Instead of one document, we'll process *many* Modern Slavery Statements.
    *   Using NLP, we will extract key entities from each statement. For this problem, the entities are precisely the categories you've defined: **Risks** (e.g., "Forced Labour"), **Controls** (e.g., "Supplier Audits"), **Geographies** (e.g., "Vietnam"), **Industries** (e.g., "Electronics"), and the **Reporting Entities** themselves (e.g., "American Express").
    *   We will construct a single, large-scale **heterogeneous Knowledge Graph**. The nodes will be the extracted entities, and the edges will represent the relationships found in the statements (e.g., `(American Express) -[IDENTIFIES_RISK]-> (Forced Labour)`, `(Forced Labour) -[IN_REGION]-> (Vietnam)`).

2.  **GNN-Powered Contextual Embeddings:**
    *   A PyG Graph Neural Network will be run over this entire graph. The GNN's role is crucial: it learns "context-aware" embeddings for every node.
    *   **Crucial Advantage:** The embedding for the "Electronics" industry node will be influenced by the embeddings of the common risks, controls, and geographies it's connected to. This is far more powerful than a simple text embedding of the word "Electronics." It captures the systemic risk landscape structurally.

3.  **RAG for Thematic Analysis:**
    *   The "user" is now an analyst or the regulator asking systemic questions (e.g., "What are the common due diligence methods in the apparel industry?").
    *   **Retrieval:** We query the GNN-powered graph. We find the "Apparel Industry" node and then **traverse the graph** to find all connected "Control" nodes that relate to due diligence.
    *   **Augmentation:** The list of retrieved methods is compiled.
    *   **Generation:** A (simulated) LLM receives this compiled list and synthesizes it into a human-readable summary, directly answering the analyst's question and forming a section of the final "Systemic Insights Report."

### **Prototype Analysis and Path to Production**

**What this Prototype Demonstrates:**

1.  **Corpus-Level Graphing:** It successfully models the process of ingesting multiple documents and building a unified knowledge graph.
2.  **Entity & Relation Extraction:** The regex-based simulation proves the concept of automatically identifying key entities (Companies, Risks, Controls, etc.) and linking them.
3.  **Graph-Based Retrieval:** Crucially, the retrieval step is not a flat semantic search. It's a **graph traversal**â€”it starts at a specific node (`Apparel`) and finds its direct neighbors of a certain type (`CONTROL`). This is a more precise and powerful way to answer analytical queries than searching over raw text.
4.  **Synthesis for Reporting:** It shows how the retrieved structured data can be fed to a generative model to synthesize the narrative sections of your "Systemic Insights Report."

**Path to Production for the Regulator's Tool:**

1.  **Data Ingestion Pipeline:** Develop a robust pipeline to automatically download all new statements from the public register, perform OCR on the PDFs, and segment the text.
2.  **Advanced NLP for Extraction:** Replace the regex patterns with a fine-tuned Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction model. This model would be trained to accurately identify the specific entities (Risks, Controls, KPIs, Industries, Geographies) and the relationships between them from the statement texts.
3.  **Graph Database:** For a national-level graph with thousands of statements, the in-memory `torch_geometric.data` object is insufficient. The extracted graph would be stored and managed in a dedicated **Graph Database** like Neo4j. This allows for complex, multi-hop queries (e.g., "Show me all companies in the Electronics sector that source from Vietnam and use third-party audits to address Forced Labour risk").
4.  **Vector Database for Embeddings:** The GNN would be run on the graph stored in Neo4j, and the resulting node embeddings would be stored in a **Vector Database** (e.g., Pinecone, Chroma) for efficient large-scale similarity and semantic search.
5.  **LLM Integration:** Connect the output to a real LLM via its API to generate the final report sections.
6.  **Interactive Dashboard:** The final tool for the regulator would likely be a dashboard (e.g., built with Streamlit or Plotly Dash) allowing analysts to ask natural language questions, which are then translated into graph queries to generate the thematic insights in real-time.
