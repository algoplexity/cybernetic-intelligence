## CIv4+5 Hypothesis v2.1: Cybernetic Intelligence and the Reality Signal

### Background

Traditional AI models often operate under rigid assumptions about the separation between simulation and perception, model and world. However, emerging insights from both cognitive neuroscience and cyber-physical system design suggest that a more viable, adaptive form of intelligence must continuously monitor and recalibrate its alignment with reality.

### Core Proposition

**Cybernetic Intelligence version 4+5 (CIv4+5)** posits that a viable agent — human or machine — maintains intelligence through *continuous comparison between internal simulation and external perception*, dynamically updating its operational mode in response to discrepancies. The central mechanism enabling this is a latent variable we define as the **Reality Signal (RS)**.

### Reality Signal (RS)

The RS is a real-time measure of alignment between internal model outputs and real-world observations. In cognitive systems, this signal is tracked in the mid-level visual cortex (fusiform gyrus), as demonstrated in Dijkstra et al. (2025). In cyber-physical systems, we define RS computationally as follows:

#### RS Definition (Cyber-Physical Formulation)

For a system with internal simulation $\hat{x}_t$ and external observation $x_t$:

$\text{RS}(t) = -\text{BDM}(x_t \oplus \hat{x}_t) + \lambda \cdot \text{BDM}(\hat{x}_t)$

* $x_t$: observed state at time $t$
* $\hat{x}_t$: predicted or simulated state at time $t$
* $\oplus$: symbolic difference or structural mismatch operator
* $\text{BDM}(\cdot)$: Block Decomposition Method complexity measure
* $\lambda$: regularization parameter controlling complexity penalty

The RS is computed over a sliding window and can be smoothed to yield $\text{RS}_w(t)$ for stability.

### Thresholding and Adaptation

A **dynamic thresholding mechanism** maps RS to categorical judgments:

* **High RS**: system is in alignment with reality — maintain course
* **Low RS**: simulation diverges from observation — structural break likely
* **Crossing Thresholds**: trigger mode switching, model updates, or coordination loop adaptation

This thresholding mechanism mirrors the brain's transformation of continuous sensory signals into binary reality judgments via frontal regions such as the anterior insula and dmPFC.

### Minimal Viable Environment: Univariate Time Series

To validate this hypothesis, we begin in a controlled environment with a single univariate time series. Here, RS is calculated as the rolling divergence between predicted and observed values, with structural breaks identified when RS drops below a learned or adaptive threshold.

This minimal setup allows:

* Empirical testing of RS dynamics
* Grounded comparison against traditional statistical methods
* Evaluation of model evolution mechanisms (e.g., AlphaEvolve)

### Broader Implications

Once validated, the RS mechanism generalizes to multivariate settings, hierarchical rule inference, and high-dimensional control environments. It offers a unified principle for reality monitoring across:

* Financial forecasting and alpha generation
* Narrative coherence in policy modeling
* Self-modeling agents in law, health, and safety contexts

### Summary

CIv4+5 hypothesizes that intelligence — cybernetic or human — depends on maintaining a stable grip on reality through an emergent signal (RS) that monitors the fidelity of internal simulations against external perception. Structural breaks emerge when RS drops, triggering adaptation. This provides a scalable architecture for viable, model-aware intelligence.
