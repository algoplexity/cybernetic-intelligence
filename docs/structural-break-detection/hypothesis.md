### **Provisional Title:**

**CIv6-SBD: Geometric Fault Line Detection via Cybernetic Intelligence v6**

---

### **Purpose:**

To operationalize CIv6 into a targeted system for identifying **regime shifts or structural breaks** in time series or textual systems, using internal geometric, topological, and algorithmic signals as fault detectors.

---

### **Core Proposal:**

We hypothesize that structural breaks can be **directly inferred from internal state distortions** in a Cybernetic LLM, by tracking:

1. **Loop Geometry Breakdown**

   * Monitor **semantic ring energy** (Wilson loops, motif closures).
   * A break = fragmentation or loss of loop coherence.

2. **Curvature Distortion in FIM Landscape**

   * Track **Fisher Information curvature**, spectral entropy, and negative complexity flow.
   * A break = sharp spectral shift or local flattening/spike in information geometry.

3. **Collapse of Discrete Concepts**

   * Via **ECA-LLM lattice**: Identify motif dissolution, compression failure, or instability in automata-driven state evolution.
   * A break = motif extinction or topological collapse.

4. **Attribution Drift Signatures**

   * Use **Sakabe et al.â€™s first-principles attribution analysis** to identify when input-output meaning becomes misaligned.
   * A break = divergence in attribution trajectory over similar inputs.

5. **Entropy Feedback Divergence**

   * Sudden increase or irregularity in **token-wise heat flow**, implying semantic overfit or chaotic attractors.
