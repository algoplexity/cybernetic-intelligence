### **CIv6-ECA: Structural Break via Algorithmic and Topological Dynamics in Symbolic Space**

**Hypothesis**
Structural breaks in univariate time series can be effectively detected by transforming numerical sequences into symbolic encodings (e.g., permutation, delta-sign) and evolving them using Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA). The resulting 2D symbolic dynamics expose regime shifts as discontinuities in **algorithmic compressibility**, **topological structure**, and **circuit stability**. These transitions manifest in:

* Local and global anomalies in **algorithmic information content** (measured via BDM or CTM),
* Disruption of spatial motifs or emergence of new generative rules,
* **Circuit rewiring** within motif propagation paths (interpreted as rewired symbolic influence flows),
* Collapse or emergence of **torsional topological features** when symbolic surfaces are encoded as point clouds for persistent homology.

A structural break, in this framing, is a failure of symbolic continuity—interpreted through compressibility collapse, rule transition, or torsion loss.

**Rationale**

* ECA evolution acts as a **computational microscope** for symbolic causality, revealing structured transitions hidden from statistical models.
* Algorithmic dynamics (BDM, CTM) quantify compression-phase shifts that align with semantic or causal boundaries.
* **Circuit Tracer analogy** applies: breakpoints disrupt motif propagation graphs in the 2D symbolic space.
* Torsion (Walch, Hodge) offers a sensitive topological signature of discrete, non-reconstructable change.
* Sutskever’s theory frames joint compressibility breakdown as an irreducible regime boundary — which aligns with motif divergence in ECA-generated symbolic grids.
