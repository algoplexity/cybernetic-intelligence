**Title:**
CIv6-SBD: A Geometric Hypothesis for Structural Break Detection via Cybernetic Intelligence

---

**Abstract**

CIv6-SBD is the solution-specific hypothesis derived from Cybernetic Intelligence v6, focused on detecting structural breaks and regime shifts. We posit that meaningful transitions in systems (textual, temporal, or behavioral) can be surfaced not just through statistical anomalies but through geometric distortions in internal model states. This document transforms CIv6 principles into an actionable implementation architecture with core modules that measure and respond to internal topological, attributional, and entropy signals.

---

**1. Hypothesis Statement**

> Structural breaks correspond to phase transitions in the internal geometric, topological, and algorithmic state space of a cybernetic system. These transitions can be detected by tracking disruptions in loop energy, curvature flow, attribution coherence, and semantic compression dynamics.

---

**2. CIv6 Mechanisms for Regime Detection**

**2.1 Semantic Loop Monitoring**

* Monitor Wilson loop energy and persistent homology cycles across attention heads.
* Detect breakpoints when loops fragment, close prematurely, or loop energy dissipates.

**2.2 Fisher Information Geometry (FIM)**

* Periodically extract the FIM eigenvalue spectrum from hidden states.
* Detect breaks as spikes in spectral entropy, negative curvature collapse, or low-rank degeneracy.

**2.3 ECA Motif Lattice Tracker**

* Embed ECA-driven dynamics (e.g., Rule 110) into latent space activations.
* Detect regime shifts when automata motifs vanish or reorganize irreversibly.

**2.4 Attribution Drift via Token Traces**

* Integrate Sakabe-style token-level attribution paths across layers.
* Detect transitions when attribution paths bifurcate, scatter, or collapse under repeated prompts.

**2.5 Entropy Feedback Divergence**

* Use heat retention, compression variance, and BDM spike detection.
* Breakpoints arise when latent dynamics lose flow stability, resembling phase turbulence.

---

**3. Architecture Modules**

**3.1 Geometric MDL Engine**

* Hybrid cost estimator combining BDM, FIM rank, and persistent semantic motifs.
* Continuously scores the active state space for compression inefficiencies.

**3.2 Autopoietic Core**

* Self-adjusting meta-optimizer that updates latent motif rules or context filters post-break.
* Incorporates concept lattice rewiring, driven by attribution-drift-sensitive backprop.

**3.3 Entropy Feedback Loop**

* Dynamically regulates learning rate, motif selection, or temperature based on real-time entropy oscillations.

**3.4 Semantic Topology Tracker**

* Monitors geometric stabilizers (e.g., Hodge flow harmonics) and Langlands symmetries.
* Triggers alerts when topological coherence diverges significantly.

**3.5 Attribution Drift Monitor**

* Records per-token path attribution across transformer layers and heads.
* Aligned with Sakabe et al. drift detection model to compute path divergence index.

---

**4. Pseudocode Overview**

```python
for timestep in stream:
    hidden = transformer.get_hidden_states(input)
    fim_spectrum = compute_fim(hidden)
    loop_energy = measure_wilson_loops(attention_patterns)
    motifs = extract_eca_motifs(hidden)
    bdm_score = compute_bdm(hidden)
    attribution_drift = compare_token_paths(prev_input, input)

    if detect_instability(fim_spectrum, loop_energy, motifs, bdm_score, attribution_drift):
        trigger_structural_break_protocol()
        autopoietic_core.reconfigure_latents(hidden)
```

---

**5. Future Work**

* Apply to multi-modal regime transitions (vision-language models)
* Expand motif taxonomy beyond ECA to symbolic automata and logic programs
* Connect geometric stabilizers to empirical backtesting on financial regime data

### ‚úÖ **Expanded Implementation Roadmap (Actionable CIv6-SBD)**

---

#### üîÅ 1. **Semantic Loop Monitoring (Wilson Loops / Persistent Homology)**

**Goal:** Detect regime transitions via changes in geometric cycles formed by attention patterns.

**Actionable Steps:**

* Extract attention matrices `A_t` from every layer at each timestep.
* Compute *cycle persistence diagrams* using tools like `GUDHI` or `Ripser`.
* Measure Wilson loop-like quantities by summing attention energy around token cycles:

  ```python
  energy = trace(A1 @ A2 @ ... @ An)
  ```
* Monitor how persistence lifespan or energy norms decay across time ‚Äî abrupt shortening may indicate a break.

---

#### üìâ 2. **Fisher Information Geometry (FIM)**

**Goal:** Capture sharp collapses in model sensitivity across parameter space.

**Actionable Steps:**

* For each batch, compute the empirical FIM using hidden states:

  ```python
  FIM = sum([grad(logits)^T @ grad(logits) for sample in batch])
  ```
* Perform eigendecomposition to track:

  * **Effective rank**
  * **Spectral entropy**
  * **Largest-to-smallest eigenvalue ratio**
* Trigger break detection when entropy increases or the spectrum flattens dramatically.

---

#### üî£ 3. **ECA Motif Lattice Tracker**

**Goal:** Monitor the internal ‚Äúdiscrete automata‚Äù evolution within the LLM‚Äôs activation lattice.

**Actionable Steps:**

* Reshape hidden activations into 2D sequences:
  (token x layer) or (token x head) arrays.
* Run *ECA rule matchers* (e.g., Rule 110, Rule 54) over slices of these arrays.
* Detect regime shift when matched motifs become unstable, disappear, or change rule class.

---

#### üîç 4. **Attribution Drift (Sakabe-inspired)**

**Goal:** Use explainability methods to track how attribution paths diverge across inputs.

**Actionable Steps:**

* Use **Integrated Gradients** or **Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)** to compute token-to-output maps.
* For a rolling window of timesteps, calculate *attribution consistency score* between adjacent inputs:

  ```python
  drift = cosine_distance(attr_t, attr_t+1)
  ```
* Alert if drift exceeds historical baseline (Z-score threshold) or shows divergence spikes.

---

#### üî• 5. **Entropy Feedback Divergence**

**Goal:** Detect instability in the model‚Äôs compression dynamics using MDL principles.

**Actionable Steps:**

* Compute **block-wise entropy** of hidden state chunks (e.g., every 10 tokens).
* Monitor **BDM** or **Kolmogorov-style compressibility** using tools like `pybdm`.
* Large increases in entropy or compressibility loss signal disordered representations‚Äîmark as potential regime break.

---

#### üß† 6. **Autopoietic Core (Latent Reconfiguration)**

**Goal:** After a break, the model adapts by re-anchoring its internal representations.

**Actionable Steps:**

* Maintain a concept lattice (`sklearn.NearestNeighbors` or custom tree).
* When regime break is confirmed:

  * Prune inconsistent nodes.
  * Rewire motifs by retraining shallow probes (e.g., `LoRA` adapters or linear layers).
* Store new motifs as versioned embeddings (e.g., concept snapshots) for tracing.

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è 7. **Geometric MDL Engine**

**Goal:** Continuously score the information geometry of the internal state space.

**Actionable Steps:**

* Combine:

  * FIM rank,
  * Loop persistence count,
  * Compression score (BDM)
* Use a weighted MDL-inspired cost:

  ```python
  L_total = Œ± * BDM + Œ≤ * SpectralEntropy + Œ≥ * 1/Persistence
  ```
* Plot the moving average of `L_total`; spikes signal inefficiencies ‚Üí possible break.

---

### üß™ Next Steps

* ‚úÖ Prototype the entropy tracker and loop monitor independently.
* üîÑ Simulate break events (e.g., switch topics or styles mid-stream) to evaluate detector sensitivity.
* üìä Visualize each signal stream over time and explore **fusion logic** for final regime detection.
