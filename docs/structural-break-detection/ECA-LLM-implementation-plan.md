Given we are working in a free-tier Google Colab setup with distributed scheduling via:

* `Coordinator_Server_Colab.ipynb`
* `Colab_Worker_Instance.ipynb`
* `Monitor_Dashboard_Colab.ipynb`

— we can now begin framing a robust and viable CIv6 prototype for structural break detection using this lightweight compute environment.

### 💡 Next Steps (CIv6 Implementation Plan - Colab Edition)

Below is a streamlined, actionable plan tailored to your setup. This version assumes you'll split computation across multiple free Colab instances, using your Coordinator–Worker–Monitor setup for orchestration.

---

## 🔧 Phase 1: System Initialization and Core Components

### 1. **Coordinator Setup (`Coordinator_Server_Colab.ipynb`)**

* Launches a simple socket or gRPC-based job manager.
* Tracks available worker notebooks and assigns tasks.
* Maintains a `JobRegistry` for:

  * `task_id`
  * `assigned_worker`
  * `task_config` (e.g., time series segment, CA ruleset, etc.)
  * `status` (pending, in-progress, complete)

**Key Additions for CIv6:**

* Accept `break_detection_job` object containing:

  * Time series chunk
  * MDL configuration
  * ECA rule seed or transformer checkpoint
  * BDM engine parameters
  * Break tracking configuration

---

## ⚙️ Phase 2: Worker Logic (`Colab_Worker_Instance.ipynb`)

Each worker should:

1. **Load Payload**:

   * Time series segment (`X_chunk`)
   * Task-specific configuration

2. **Run the CIv6 Loop**:

   * Apply ECA or Transformer-driven rule
   * Evaluate BDM complexity before and after break simulation
   * Track entropy transitions (e.g., Shannon entropy, Lempel-Ziv, or BDM)
   * Compute `delta-complexity` to infer break plausibility

3. **Emit Results**:

   * Annotated time segment
   * `structural_break_likelihood`
   * Internal state evolution (for diagnostics)
   * Agent trace (for viability & autopoiesis assessment)

---

## 📈 Phase 3: Monitor Dashboard (`Monitor_Dashboard_Colab.ipynb`)

* Real-time log stream from all workers
* Visualization of:

  * Detected breaks
  * Entropy evolution over time
  * Rule variation effectiveness
  * Agent loop viability (based on loop duration, correction behavior, etc.)

---

## 🧠 Phase 4: Embed CIv6 Logics

### 1. **CIv6 Loop Components**

Each iteration in the worker includes:

* **Entropy Tracker**: Tracks BDM/Shannon/LZ entropy at each timepoint
* **Loop Monitor**: Monitors rule application cycles and early exit conditions
* **State Evolution Manager**: Retains system state history (for emergent behavior detection)
* **Recombination Engine** *(optional)*: Introduces a new rule candidate from a transformer inference or recombination of existing rules

### 2. **Structural Break Hypothesis Evaluation**

* Break is accepted if:

  * `Δ(MDL_BDM) > threshold`
  * Entropy increase is persistent across local windows
  * Loop behavior becomes unstable or switches attractors

---

## 📤 Phase 5: Result Aggregation & Summary

* Coordinator aggregates outputs
* Runs ensemble scoring across workers
* Produces final JSON or CSV of:

  * Breakpoints
  * Confidence scores
  * Supporting entropy + complexity traces

---

## 🪛 Libraries Needed

* `pybdm` for BDM (or your approximation if pybdm too heavy)
* `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`
* Optional: `transformers` for rule synthesis or mutation
* `socket`, `asyncio` or `multiprocessing.connection` for IPC
