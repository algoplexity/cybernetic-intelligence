**CIv6-ECA: Structural Break via Algorithmic Dynamics**

**Hypothesis**
Structural breaks in univariate time series can be effectively detected by translating numerical series into symbolic sequences through permutation encoding and evolving these sequences via Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA). The resulting 2D symbolic dynamics serve as a substrate for identifying regime shifts based on changes in algorithmic complexity, spatial motif disruption, and divergence in the underlying generative rules. Structural breaks manifest as discontinuities or anomalies in the compressibility or algorithmic information content (e.g., via Block Decomposition Method, BDM) of the ECA-evolved output. Thus, structural change is framed as a transition in the algorithmic generative process itself, rather than mere statistical deviation.

**Rationale**

* ECA evolution over binarized input exposes deep temporal and symbolic patterns that standard models overlook.
* Algorithmic complexity measures like BDM or CTM estimate the information content of 2D motifs and detect shifts in rule-consistent compressibility.
* Structural breaks are aligned with causal discontinuities in symbolic dynamics, enabling rule inference.

**CIv6-LLM: Structural Break via Topological/Algebraic Reasoning**

**Hypothesis**
Structural breaks in time series data can be detected by embedding the binarized symbolic sequence into a transformer architecture trained or tuned for semantic field awareness, topological loop detection, and algebraic feature shift. The transformer acts as a geometric-algebraic engine, mapping the tokenized input to latent manifolds and identifying changes in curvature, attention patterns, and concept cohomology that signal regime shifts. This approach treats LLMs as reasoning machines capable of modeling higher-order transformations and semantic discontinuities in the symbolic representation of time-evolving data.

**Rationale**

* Transformers implicitly learn attention-based topologies and algebraic patterns.
* Structural breaks emerge as disruptions in semantic ring cycles or latent field alignments.
* Recent findings in LLM internals (FIM, BDM, curvature, inductive biases) support their use as meta-reasoners for signal irregularities.
