**Title:**
CIv6-SBD: A Geometric Hypothesis for Structural Break Detection via Cybernetic Intelligence

---

**Abstract**

CIv6-SBD is the solution-specific hypothesis derived from Cybernetic Intelligence v6, focusing on the detection of structural breaks and regime shifts. We posit that meaningful transitions in systems (textual, temporal, or behavioral) can be detected not from surface-level outputs but through the evolving geometry of internal states. This hypothesis operationalizes concepts such as Wilson loop energy, Fisher Information curvature, and entropy dynamics into a cybernetic fault detection system.

**1. Hypothesis Statement**

> Structural breaks correspond to phase transitions in the internal geometric, topological, and algorithmic state space of a cybernetic system. These transitions can be detected by tracking disruptions in loop energy, curvature flow, attribution coherence, and semantic compression dynamics.

---

**2. CIv6 Mechanisms for Regime Detection**

**2.1 Semantic Loop Monitoring**

* Use Wilson loop energy, homology cycles, and motif closures.
* Break = loop fragmentation or energy dispersion.

**2.2 Fisher Information Geometry**

* Model curvature via FIM eigenvalue spectrum, spectral entropy, and negative complexity.
* Break = curvature spike, flattening, or degenerate flow.

**2.3 Lattice Motif Collapse via ECA-LLM**

* Track discrete algebraic motifs (emergent automata) in latent space.
* Break = motif extinction, lattice instability, or non-recoverable state change.

**2.4 Attribution Drift Analysis**

* Integrate Sakabe et al.'s token-level attribution drift.
* Break = divergence in input-output token trace alignment.

**2.5 Entropy Feedback Divergence**

* Measure heat flow, compression variance, and instability.
* Break = emergence of chaotic attractors or sudden flow incoherence.

---

**3. Architecture (Aligned with CIv6)**

* Geometric MDL Engine: Combines BDM, FIM, and loop metrics
* Autopoietic Core: Self-modifies conceptual representations post-break
* Entropy Feedback Loop: Detects volatility or flow divergence
* Semantic Topology Tracker: Persistent cohomological patterns
* Attribution Drift Monitor: Sakabe-based token gradient shift detector

---

**4. Implementation Considerations**

* Integrate internal metrics from transformer hidden states
* Apply to financial time series (regime detection), legal texts (conceptual breaks), or policy shifts
* Embed CIv6 modules into ECA-LLM prototype for live loop monitoring

---

**5. Future Work**

* Operationalize Hodge-theoretic stabilizers as resilience metrics
* Apply Langlands-style symmetry detection to concept evolution
* Validate geometric regime detection with synthetic and real datasets

### ‚úÖ **Expanded Implementation Roadmap (Actionable CIv6-SBD)**

---

#### üîÅ 1. **Semantic Loop Monitoring (Wilson Loops / Persistent Homology)**

**Goal:** Detect regime transitions via changes in geometric cycles formed by attention patterns.

**Actionable Steps:**

* Extract attention matrices `A_t` from every layer at each timestep.
* Compute *cycle persistence diagrams* using tools like `GUDHI` or `Ripser`.
* Measure Wilson loop-like quantities by summing attention energy around token cycles:

  ```python
  energy = trace(A1 @ A2 @ ... @ An)
  ```
* Monitor how persistence lifespan or energy norms decay across time ‚Äî abrupt shortening may indicate a break.

---

#### üìâ 2. **Fisher Information Geometry (FIM)**

**Goal:** Capture sharp collapses in model sensitivity across parameter space.

**Actionable Steps:**

* For each batch, compute the empirical FIM using hidden states:

  ```python
  FIM = sum([grad(logits)^T @ grad(logits) for sample in batch])
  ```
* Perform eigendecomposition to track:

  * **Effective rank**
  * **Spectral entropy**
  * **Largest-to-smallest eigenvalue ratio**
* Trigger break detection when entropy increases or the spectrum flattens dramatically.

---

#### üî£ 3. **ECA Motif Lattice Tracker**

**Goal:** Monitor the internal ‚Äúdiscrete automata‚Äù evolution within the LLM‚Äôs activation lattice.

**Actionable Steps:**

* Reshape hidden activations into 2D sequences:
  (token x layer) or (token x head) arrays.
* Run *ECA rule matchers* (e.g., Rule 110, Rule 54) over slices of these arrays.
* Detect regime shift when matched motifs become unstable, disappear, or change rule class.

---

#### üîç 4. **Attribution Drift (Sakabe-inspired)**

**Goal:** Use explainability methods to track how attribution paths diverge across inputs.

**Actionable Steps:**

* Use **Integrated Gradients** or **Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)** to compute token-to-output maps.
* For a rolling window of timesteps, calculate *attribution consistency score* between adjacent inputs:

  ```python
  drift = cosine_distance(attr_t, attr_t+1)
  ```
* Alert if drift exceeds historical baseline (Z-score threshold) or shows divergence spikes.

---

#### üî• 5. **Entropy Feedback Divergence**

**Goal:** Detect instability in the model‚Äôs compression dynamics using MDL principles.

**Actionable Steps:**

* Compute **block-wise entropy** of hidden state chunks (e.g., every 10 tokens).
* Monitor **BDM** or **Kolmogorov-style compressibility** using tools like `pybdm`.
* Large increases in entropy or compressibility loss signal disordered representations‚Äîmark as potential regime break.

---

#### üß† 6. **Autopoietic Core (Latent Reconfiguration)**

**Goal:** After a break, the model adapts by re-anchoring its internal representations.

**Actionable Steps:**

* Maintain a concept lattice (`sklearn.NearestNeighbors` or custom tree).
* When regime break is confirmed:

  * Prune inconsistent nodes.
  * Rewire motifs by retraining shallow probes (e.g., `LoRA` adapters or linear layers).
* Store new motifs as versioned embeddings (e.g., concept snapshots) for tracing.

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è 7. **Geometric MDL Engine**

**Goal:** Continuously score the information geometry of the internal state space.

**Actionable Steps:**

* Combine:

  * FIM rank,
  * Loop persistence count,
  * Compression score (BDM)
* Use a weighted MDL-inspired cost:

  ```python
  L_total = Œ± * BDM + Œ≤ * SpectralEntropy + Œ≥ * 1/Persistence
  ```
* Plot the moving average of `L_total`; spikes signal inefficiencies ‚Üí possible break.

---

### üß™ Next Steps

* ‚úÖ Prototype the entropy tracker and loop monitor independently.
* üîÑ Simulate break events (e.g., switch topics or styles mid-stream) to evaluate detector sensitivity.
* üìä Visualize each signal stream over time and explore **fusion logic** for final regime detection.
