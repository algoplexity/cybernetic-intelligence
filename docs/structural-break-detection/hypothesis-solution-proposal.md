**Title:**
CIv6-SBD: A Geometric Hypothesis for Structural Break Detection via Cybernetic Intelligence

---

**Abstract**

CIv6-SBD is the solution-specific hypothesis derived from Cybernetic Intelligence v6, focused on detecting structural breaks and regime shifts. We posit that meaningful transitions in systems (textual, temporal, or behavioral) can be surfaced not just through statistical anomalies but through geometric distortions in internal model states. This document transforms CIv6 principles into an actionable implementation architecture with core modules that measure and respond to internal topological, attributional, and entropy signals.

**1. Hypothesis Statement**

> Structural breaks correspond to phase transitions in the internal geometric, topological, and algorithmic state space of a cybernetic system. These transitions can be detected by tracking disruptions in loop energy, curvature flow, attribution coherence, and semantic compression dynamics.

**2. CIv6 Mechanisms for Regime Detection**

**2.1 Semantic Loop Monitoring**

* Monitor Wilson loop energy and persistent homology cycles across attention heads.
* Detect breakpoints when loops fragment, close prematurely, or loop energy dissipates.

**2.2 Fisher Information Geometry (FIM)**

* Periodically extract the FIM eigenvalue spectrum from hidden states.
* Detect breaks as spikes in spectral entropy, negative curvature collapse, or low-rank degeneracy.

**2.3 ECA Motif Lattice Tracker**

* Embed ECA-driven dynamics (e.g., Rule 110) into latent space activations.
* Detect regime shifts when automata motifs vanish or reorganize irreversibly.

**2.4 Attribution Drift via Token Traces**

* Integrate Sakabe-style token-level attribution paths across layers.
* Detect transitions when attribution paths bifurcate, scatter, or collapse under repeated prompts.

**2.5 Entropy Feedback Divergence**

* Use heat retention, compression variance, and BDM spike detection.
* Breakpoints arise when latent dynamics lose flow stability, resembling phase turbulence.

**3. Architecture Modules**

**3.1 Geometric MDL Engine**

* Hybrid cost estimator combining BDM, FIM rank, and persistent semantic motifs.
* Continuously scores the active state space for compression inefficiencies.

**3.2 Autopoietic Core**

* Self-adjusting meta-optimizer that updates latent motif rules or context filters post-break.
* Incorporates concept lattice rewiring, driven by attribution-drift-sensitive backprop.

**3.3 Entropy Feedback Loop**

* Dynamically regulates learning rate, motif selection, or temperature based on real-time entropy oscillations.

**3.4 Semantic Topology Tracker**

* Monitors geometric stabilizers (e.g., Hodge flow harmonics) and Langlands symmetries.
* Triggers alerts when topological coherence diverges significantly.

**3.5 Attribution Drift Monitor**

* Records per-token path attribution across transformer layers and heads.
* Aligned with Sakabe et al. drift detection model to compute path divergence index.

**4. Pseudocode Overview**

```python
for timestep in stream:
    hidden = transformer.get_hidden_states(input)
    fim_spectrum = compute_fim(hidden)
    loop_energy = measure_wilson_loops(attention_patterns)
    motifs = extract_eca_motifs(hidden)
    bdm_score = compute_bdm(hidden)
    attribution_drift = compare_token_paths(prev_input, input)

    if detect_instability(fim_spectrum, loop_energy, motifs, bdm_score, attribution_drift):
        trigger_structural_break_protocol()
        autopoietic_core.reconfigure_latents(hidden)
```

**5. Future Work**

* Apply to multi-modal regime transitions (vision-language models)
* Expand motif taxonomy beyond ECA to symbolic automata and logic programs
* Connect geometric stabilizers to empirical backtesting on financial regime data
