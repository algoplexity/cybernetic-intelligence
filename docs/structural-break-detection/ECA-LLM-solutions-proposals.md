**Solution Proposal: CIv6-ECA — Structural Break via Algorithmic Dynamics**

**Overview:**
This solution leverages Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA) as a substrate to detect structural breaks in univariate time series. We hypothesize that structural breaks can be interpreted as transitions in the underlying generative algorithm of the observed sequence. Our approach uses ECA dynamics to discover minimal programs that best approximate the temporal structure of binarized market data.

**Pipeline:**

1. **Binarization via Permutation Encoding:**

   * Apply ordinal pattern encoding (e.g., permutation entropy) to convert time series into binary (or ternary) sequences.
   * This preserves ordinal information while reducing the search space.

2. **Candidate ECA Rule Evaluation:**

   * Iterate over a set of ECA rules (or rule tuples).
   * For each rule, simulate ECA evolution from various initial configurations.
   * Compare generated 2D spacetime patterns against observed sequences.

3. **Fitness Score:**

   * Use Minimum Description Length (MDL) and Block Decomposition Method (BDM) to estimate the algorithmic complexity.
   * The fitness score rewards low-complexity rules that accurately reproduce the observed sequence.

4. **Rule Evolution:**

   * Employ black-box optimizers (e.g., genetic algorithms) to evolve rules and initial conditions.
   * Introduce symbolic or pattern-based constraints to reduce search entropy.

5. **Structural Break Detection:**

   * Sliding window comparison of best-fit rules.
   * Structural break is signaled when a shift in best-fit rule or a spike in MDL/BDM complexity is observed.

6. **Visualization & Interpretation:**

   * Render 2D ECA dynamics of detected regimes.
   * Interpret learned rules as causal generators, enhancing interpretability.

**Advantages:**

* Fully symbolic and interpretable.
* Aligned with Occam’s Razor (Grosse et al.) and Attribution Drift theory (Sakabe et al.).
* Naturally captures discrete generative shifts.

**Solution Proposal: CIv6-LLM — Structural Break via Topological/Algebraic Reasoning**

**Overview:**
This approach frames structural break detection as a problem of identifying discontinuities in the latent topology of a time series encoded by a transformer model. The transformer is trained to recognize patterns in binarized sequences and reason over them using internal algebraic and topological structures (e.g., attention loops, semantic rings).

---

**Pipeline:**

1. **Input Encoding:**

   * Use permutation encoding to transform time series into token sequences.
   * Optionally represent inputs as paths or graphs (e.g., persistence barcodes).

2. **Transformer Architecture:**

   * Pre-train or fine-tune a small transformer on binarized/masked forecasting tasks.
   * Use FIM (Forward Interpolation Masking) or BERT-style masking to train over structure, not prediction.

3. **Topological Drift Detection:**

   * Monitor attention maps, residual norms, and internal state trajectories.
   * Use algebraic geometry or persistent homology to detect topological distortions.

4. **Latent Complexity Metrics:**

   * Apply MDL, BDM, or curvature-based metrics on internal activations.
   * Discontinuities in these metrics signal structural breaks.

5. **Symbolic Abstractions:**

   * Leverage emergent clusters in the transformer’s latent space to form high-level symbols.
   * Track evolution of these clusters across time windows.

6. **Interpretability Layer:**

   * Visualize embeddings and attention trajectories.
   * Map changes in activation manifolds to narrative breaks.

---

**Advantages:**

* Captures latent structural information without explicit rule enumeration.
* Compatible with existing transformer infrastructure.
* Allows algebraic/topological abstraction of time series changes.

Both approaches are designed to be complementary. CIv6-ECA focuses on **symbolic causal program discovery**, while CIv6-LLM emphasizes **topological discontinuity in latent space**. A hybrid could emerge where LLMs help guide ECA rule discovery or interpret rule transitions.
