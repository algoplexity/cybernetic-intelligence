**Hypothesis: Adaptive, Algorithmically-Principled Detection and Characterization of Structural Breaks in Time Series using Elementary Cellular Automata and Algorithmic Information Theory**

**1. Overarching Hypothesis:**

We hypothesize that structural breaks in time series data, representing fundamental shifts in the underlying data-generating process, can be effectively detected, characterized, and efficiently analyzed through an integrated framework founded on algorithmic information theory (AIT) and generative modeling:

1.  **ECA as Generative Process Model:** The intrinsic dynamics of a given time series segment can be captured by an optimal Elementary Cellular Automaton (ECA) rule [cf. Wolfram, 1983; Wolfram, 2002]. This rule is identified via an algorithmic search (e.g., Genetic Algorithm), potentially enhanced by LLM-guided evolutionary principles [cf. Novikov et al., "AlphaEvolve", 2025], aiming to find an ECA whose generated spatio-temporal pattern most closely matches the core algorithmic structure of the observed data segment.

2.  **Principled Binary Representation & MILS for Core Structure Extraction:** To facilitate robust ECA modeling and algorithmic comparison, the original continuous time series segment is first transformed into a 2D binary array using an *optimal encoding scheme*. This scheme is pre-selected for its ability to produce MILS-processed binary representations where structural changes are most discernible by an auxiliary ECA dynamics model. The resulting raw binary array (`B_raw`) is then further refined using Minimal Information Loss Selection (MILS) [cf. Mak, Y.W., Thesis; Kiani et al., 2023]—a GA-driven process guided by BDM to select informative rows/columns—to produce a compressed representation (`B_mils_observed`). This step is crucial as it aims to distill the causally relevant algorithmic regularities [cf. **Sakabe et al., 2025**] from potentially noisy or redundant initial binary data, creating a representation that better reflects the underlying generative structure. Similarly, raw patterns generated by candidate ECAs (`Pattern_raw_ECA`) are also processed by MILS to yield `MILS_Pattern_ECA` for fair comparison.

3.  **BDM-MDL for Break Adjudication (Leveraging BDM's Sensitivity to Algorithmic Structure):** A structural break is indicated if modeling the MILS-processed observed data (`B_mils_pre` and `B_mils_post`) with two distinct optimal ECA rules (Rule_A and Rule_B, respectively) yields a significantly shorter total Minimum Description Length (MDL) [Rissanen, 1978; Grünwald & Roos, 2019] than modeling the entire MILS-processed series (`B_mils_full`) with a single optimal ECA rule (Rule_Global). Description lengths are approximated using the Block Decomposition Method (BDM) [Zenil et al., 2018; Soler-Toscano et al., 2014]. BDM is chosen for its demonstrated ability to more closely track structural changes and algorithmic regularities in binarized representations than entropy-based statistical measures [**Sakabe et al., 2025**], making it a more sensitive measure for the MDL calculation. The core MDL comparison, applied to the information-theoretic distance (e.g., BDM of the XOR difference) between `B_mils_observed` patterns and their corresponding `MILS_Pattern_ECA`, is:
    `Break_Evidence_Score = BDM(B_mils_full | Rule_Global) - [BDM(B_mils_pre | Rule_A) + BDM(B_mils_post | Rule_B)]`.

4.  **Transformer-Augmented Fidelity Assessment & Rule Discovery:** An offline-trained Transformer, proficient in predicting ECA evolutions [Burtsev, 2024] (`ECA_Dynamics_Transformer`), serves complementary roles:
    *   **Optimal Encoding Selection (Offline):** Aids in selecting the initial binary encoding scheme.
    *   **Dynamic Fidelity Check (Online):** Assesses the dynamic consistency of an identified ECA rule with a subsequent data segment.
    *   **Efficient Rule Exploration (Potential):** Can guide or accelerate the GA search for optimal ECA rules [cf. Novikov et al., "AlphaEvolve", 2025].

5.  **Adaptive Application for Efficiency:** The computationally intensive MILS, GA-ECA rule search, and detailed BDM-MDL scoring will be applied adaptively [cf. Fang, Ma, & Wang, 2025], triggered only when simpler heuristics indicate a potential structural break.

6.  **Interpretable Characterization:** Detected structural breaks will be analyzed using causal decomposition of the ECA rules [Riedel & Zenil, 2018], providing insights into changes in algorithmic dynamics.

This integrated approach, leveraging BDM's proven sensitivity to algorithmic structure within an MDL framework, is expected to yield superior detection accuracy, enhanced interpretability, and practical efficiency.

**2. Core Problem Statement (Addressing the ADIA Challenge):**

Traditional methods for structural break detection often rely on statistical assumptions, can be computationally inefficient when applied uniformly, or provide limited insight into the qualitative nature of the change. We propose a novel, adaptive framework that synergizes the generative power of ECAs, the principled model selection of MDL (via BDM on MILS-processed data), and the dynamic assessment capabilities of specialized Transformers. This approach aims to efficiently detect breaks with high accuracy (measured by ROC AUC) and provide an algorithmic characterization of *how* the system's dynamics have altered, determining *when* deep algorithmic analysis is warranted.

**3. Key Research Questions (Revised to align with the new hypothesis):**

*   **RQ1 (Optimal Encoding & MILS Efficacy):** Which initial binary encoding scheme, when coupled with MILS preprocessing, produces MILS-compressed binary representations (`B_mils`) that best facilitate subsequent ECA modeling and yield the most discriminative BDM-based MDL scores for structural break detection on the ADIA training data?
*   **RQ2 (ECA-MDL Detection Performance):** Can the core ECA-GA-MILS-BDM-MDL pipeline achieve competitive or superior ROC AUC in detecting structural breaks compared to baseline methods, using the optimal encoding identified in RQ1?
*   **RQ3 (Transformer Augmentation Value):** How significantly does augmenting the BDM-MDL score with a Transformer-based fidelity assessment of ECA rules [Burtsev, 2024] improve structural break detection accuracy or confidence? Can the Transformer also assist in more efficient ECA rule discovery?
*   **RQ4 (Adaptive Framework Benefits):** Does the proposed adaptive framework [Fang, Ma, & Wang, 2025] successfully reduce computational load for structural break detection while maintaining or minimally impacting ROC AUC performance compared to a non-adaptive full analysis?
*   **RQ5 (Interpretability of Breaks):** Can the causal decomposition of differing pre-break (Rule_A) and post-break (Rule_B) ECA rules provide meaningful and interpretable insights into the qualitative nature of the detected structural changes [Riedel & Zenil, 2018]?
