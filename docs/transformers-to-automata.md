# From Transformers to Automata: Converging Paths Toward Cybernetic Intelligence

What if transformer-based LLMs and emergent models from cellular automata aren't opposing approaches, but complementary systems on a convergent path?

This article is a conceptual continuation of our prior work, *Beyond the Context Window*, but takes a new entry point focused on the structural and recursive capacities of adaptive AI systems...

**Title:**
From Transformers to Automata: Converging Paths Toward Cybernetic Intelligence

**Introduction: Two Ladders to the Same Mountain**

For years, the trajectory of AI has followed the ascent of large language models (LLMs), pushing ever-larger context windows, multi-modal encoders, and prompt engineering toward a kind of industrialized cognition. Yet, an unexpected path has recently emerged from an entirely different landscape: *cellular automata*.

What if these two seemingly divergent paths — transformer-based recursive refinement and local-rule emergent models — are not competitors, but complementary halves of a more powerful paradigm?

This article is a conceptual continuation of our prior work, *Beyond the Context Window*, which framed viable AI systems as cybernetic ecosystems. Here, we introduce an alternate perspective to that same body of knowledge: a new entry point rooted in the convergence of self-refining LLMs and structurally adaptive automata.

**1. Recursive Refinement in LLMs: From Fine-Tuning to Self-Tuning**

In "Think, Prune, Train, Improve" (Costello et al., 2025), transformer-based LLMs demonstrate remarkable capacity for self-improvement:

* They generate their own data based on internal heuristics.
* They filter ("prune") outputs for correctness.
* They fine-tune themselves based on internally selected samples.

This is not yet autonomy — but it is **recursion with intent**. It demonstrates a model beginning to *adapt its own training loop* based on its own outputs. In the framework of *Beyond the Context Window*, this is a strong instantiation of Viable System Model (VSM) functions:

* System 3 (Optimization)
* System 4 (Environmental Scanning)
* System 1 (Domain-Specific Execution)

Recursive LLMs are beginning to **observe and modify their own behavior** — a critical property of viable systems.

**2. Emergent Models: Intelligence from Local Rules**

On the other end of the AI landscape, Giacomo Bocchese and collaborators have proposed *Emergent Models* (EMs) — systems built on cellular automata. Rather than optimizing static parameters, these models:

* Evolve through simple local rule applications.
* Exhibit global behavior through distributed interactions.
* Are **Turing-complete** — capable of expressing any computable process.

Unlike transformers, these systems are inherently **self-modifying** in a structural sense — they don't just learn better weights; they potentially evolve **new rules of operation**. This opens a door to systems that adapt not just their predictions, but their fundamental *ways of thinking*.

---

**3. The Meeting Point: Structural + Representational Adaptation**

Here lies the exciting convergence:

* **LLMs adapt representations**, optimizing over tasks.
* **EMs adapt structures**, modifying operational logic.

Together, these form the outline of a **dual-adaptive system**:

* A reasoning substrate (e.g., an LLM) that can refine task outputs, model internal state, and communicate meaning.
* An emergent engine (e.g., CA-based system) that evolves its architecture in response to long-term pressure.

This mirrors **biological intelligence** — where neurons carry representations, but epigenetic systems evolve structure.

---

**4. Reframing the Cybernetic Teammate from This Perspective**

In *Beyond the Context Window*, we framed AI systems as cybernetic collectives:

* Distributed agents with role specialization
* Internal state modeling for routing and memory
* Semantic graphs for structural context
* Human-AI teaming for shared viability

Seen from the EM+LLM convergence, we now revise the system boundary:

> The AI agent is not a fixed-function transformer. It is a **living process** — recursively improving itself (like an LLM), and evolving how it improves (like an EM).

The human no longer just "manages" this system. Instead:

* The human *co-evolves* the task space.
* The platform *co-adapts* rules of representation.
* The agent *co-discovers* its structure.

This is cybernetics in motion — feedback not just on what we *do*, but on how we *construct meaning* and *restructure capability*.

---

**5. Implications: A New Viability Frontier**

With this convergence, we begin to answer deeper questions:

* How can systems correct for representational collapse? (Observer Theory)
* Can agents learn not just content, but learning processes?
* Can ecosystems of AI + humans evolve *without bloating* context windows?

The answer may lie in building:

* **Recursive reasoners** (LLMs)
* Over **emergent substrates** (EMs)
* Embedded in **adaptive human-in-the-system architectures**

This shifts us from *architecture as scaffold* to *architecture as co-evolving organism*.

---

**Conclusion: From Abstraction to Adaptation**

Choosing this frame — recursive meets emergent — is another representation, another collapse of possibility into action. But unlike static frames, this one can respond. It moves. It learns. It adapts.

And if AI systems are to be truly viable, they must learn to do the same.

> The future of AI is not bigger models. It's *living systems that evolve their own intelligence*.

This article is an alternate entry into our broader cybernetic teammate theory. For a complementary representation grounded in context modeling, role specialization, and ecosystem architecture, see: [**Beyond the Context Window**](link-to-article).
