What if transformer-based LLMs and emergent models from cellular automata aren't opposing approaches, but complementary systems on a convergent path?

This article is a conceptual continuation of our prior work, *Beyond the Context Window*, but takes a new entry point focused on the structural and recursive capacities of adaptive AI systems...
