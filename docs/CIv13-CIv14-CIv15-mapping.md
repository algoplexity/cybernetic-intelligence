| **CIv13** | ✔ Captures discrete rules and abstract patterns from sequences; symbolic encoder extracts regime-specific motifs                          | ✔ Latent encoder captures compressed representations of sequence dynamics                  | ✖ Minimal integration: divergence between symbolic and latent streams signals structural breaks                                            | Focused on **detection**; divergence (symbolic vs latent) is the measurable signal; no forecasting or adaptation                                                                                  |
| **CIv14** | ✔ Symbolic encoder continues to extract minimal generative programs; outputs φ-scored sketches                                            | ✔ Latent encoder continues to capture compressed dynamics                                  | ✔ **Decompression/forecaster integrates symbolic and latent streams**; ΔBDM and ΔMDL combine with divergence to produce regime probability | Focus shifts from detection → **dynamic modeling**; system uses both substrates to **forecast** next sequences and explain regime changes; interpretable symbolic outputs exposed to stakeholders |
| **CIv15** | ✔ Symbolic programs become **self-editing**, stored in versioned program library; supports causal perturbation and counterfactual testing | ✔ Latent encoder continues to capture compressed trends; used for divergence + forecasting | ✔ **Autopoietic loop unifies symbolic + latent + action evaluation**; controller edits programs based on ΔMDL, φ, and utility              | Focus moves from dynamic viability → **self-maintaining, planning, open-ended learning**; full neurosymbolic autopoietic integration; actionable outputs for downstream systems                   |
