# ðŸ§© **Solution Proposal: Autonomous Alpha Generation Agent using AZR and R\&D-Agent(Q) on the WorldQuant BRAIN Platform**

---

## **1. Overview**

This proposal outlines the development of a modular, multi-agent system for **autonomously generating novel, decorrelated alpha expressions** using a compact LLM trained entirely through **self-supervised interaction with the WorldQuant BRAIN platform**. The agent will combine:

* The **R\&D-Agent(Q)** architecture for structured multi-agent task flow, and
* The **Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR)** training method for curriculum-free, reward-driven optimization.

---

## **2. Motivation**

The alpha discovery process in quantitative finance suffers from:

* A diminishing pool of novel, decorrelated signals;
* Overreliance on complex, pretrained models that are difficult to audit or adapt;
* Empirical fragility in signal performance due to modeling artifacts (Buncic, 2024).

Recent breakthroughs in **multi-agent LLM architectures (Zhang et al., 2024)** and **reward-driven reasoning without supervision (Chen et al., 2024)** offer a promising alternative: compact models that learn from environment feedback, not labels.

This system will serve as a testbed for applying this integrated architecture to a real-world, high-stakes domain: alpha factor mining on the WorldQuant BRAIN platform.

## **3. Proposed Solution**

We propose a **multi-agent LLM system** that learns to generate Fast Expressions â€” the DSL used in BRAIN to construct alpha signals â€” entirely through interaction with the BRAIN backtesting environment.

### ðŸ”§ Architecture: **R\&D-Agent(Q)-Inspired System**

| Agent Role               | Description                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Proposer**             | LLM generates candidate Fast Expressions in valid DSL syntax.                                     |
| **Implementer**          | Wraps the expression into a BRAIN-compatible format and runs simulation via the Python API.       |
| **Validator**            | Extracts key metrics (Fitness, Sharpe, turnover, decorrelation) from backtest results.            |
| **Critic**               | Assesses novelty, stability, and adherence to constraints; filters poor outputs.                  |
| **Scheduler** (optional) | Bandit-based role switching (e.g., prioritize exploration, refinement, or high-confidence picks). |

### ðŸ§  Training Method: **Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR)**

The system uses **AZR-style curriculum-free self-play**:

* No pretraining, labeled examples, or human priors.
* Rewards are derived from simulator feedback (Sharpe, Fitness, decorrelation).
* LLM weights are updated via REINFORCE++, PPO, or similar techniques using `trl` or `Unsloth`.

---

## **4. Technical Implementation**

### Phase 1 â€“ MVP Bootstrapping

* Seed the proposer with trivial valid expressions (e.g., `rank(close)`).
* Set up BRAIN API wrapper (`ace_lib`) to run expressions and extract metrics.
* Build reward function using simulator outputs.

### Phase 2 â€“ Closed-Loop Training

* Implement AZR loop to propose, simulate, score, and learn.
* Maintain a replay buffer of all expressionâ€“reward pairs.
* Track correlation to prior alphas and penalize duplicates.

### Phase 3 â€“ Multi-Agent Integration

* Expand beyond single-loop AZR to R\&D-Agent(Q) roles:

  * **Critic** to filter redundant or trivial expressions.
  * **Scheduler** to toggle strategies (e.g., exploration vs. exploitation).

### Phase 4 â€“ Reporting and Export

* Generate a report/dashboard of discovered alphas.
* Log performance trends and agent reasoning improvements over time.

## **5. Innovations and Contributions**

| Area               | Contribution                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Methodological** | Demonstrates the effectiveness of AZR in a financial setting with zero pretraining.           |
| **Architectural**  | Combines AZR with the modular agent structure of R\&D-Agent(Q) for enhanced interpretability. |
| **Practical**      | Produces high-Fitness, decorrelated Fast Expressions on real data using only API access.      |
| **Computational**  | Can run on Colab-tier compute using LoRA, TRL, and lightweight 1B models.                     |

## **6. Alignment with Research & Investment Goals**

* Advances **zero-data, verifiable-agent design** in financial research.
* Reduces **development time and human bias** in alpha discovery pipelines.
* Lays foundation for **general-purpose simulator-driven LLMs** beyond finance (science, policy, etc.).
