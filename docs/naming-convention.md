Agreed — defining a precise naming convention is critical at this stage. It will help us:

1. **Reference components unambiguously** during internal planning and external discussions.
2. **Strategically layer IP protection**, distinguishing between public-facing ideas, collaborative modules, and core proprietary innovations.
3. **Modularize implementation**, making it easier to assign workstreams and manage dependencies.
4. **Align contributors** around shared vocabulary as the project scales.

I suggest we begin by drafting a taxonomy of naming conventions across four layers:

* **\[Layer 0] CIv7 Core Hypotheses & Principles** — e.g. CIv7-ECA, CIv7-LLM, CIv7-Unified
* **\[Layer 1] Architecture Modules** — e.g. CIv7-GMC (Geometric MDL Core), CIv7-SAT (Semantic Attribution Tracker)
* **\[Layer 2] Implementation Functions** — e.g. `compute_bdm_curvature()`, `detect_torsion_instability()`
* **\[Layer 3] Solution Deployments** — e.g. CIv7-SBD (Structural Break Detection), CIv7-TI (Thematic Intelligence), CIv7-Synth (Synthetic Generation)

Shall we begin drafting this CIv7 Taxonomy & Naming Convention document?

**CIv7 Naming Taxonomy and Layered Naming Convention**

---

**Purpose:**
To enable clear internal and external communication, modular implementation, IP layering, and collaboration through a unified naming scheme across the CIv7 suite of hypotheses, modules, and implementations.

---

### **\[Layer 0] CIv7 Core Hypotheses and Frameworks**

> *Abstract, foundational theories underpinning all downstream modules.*

* `CIv7-ECA`
  Symbolic substrate dynamics via cellular automata
* `CIv7-LLM`
  Topological-algebraic reasoning in transformer architectures
* `CIv7-UNIFIED`
  Integration of symbolic and geometric reasoning systems

---

### **\[Layer 1] Core Architectural Modules**

> *Named internal components, each aligned with key mechanisms proposed in CIv7.*

* `CIv7-GMC` — Geometric MDL Core
  BDM, Fisher spectrum, negative complexity

* `CIv7-SAT` — Semantic Attribution Tracker
  Token path divergence, drift monitoring

* `CIv7-EFM` — Entropy Feedback Monitor
  Entropy spikes, energy loss, flow disruption

* `CIv7-JCA` — Joint Compression Analyzer
  Sutskever-style prediction-as-compression logic

* `CIv7-MRT` — Motif Rewiring Tracker
  ECA latent motif evolution and regime lattice formation

* `CIv7-TGM` — Topological Geometry Monitor
  Wilson loops, Hodge forms, torsion shifts, harmonic stability

* `CIv7-ACU` — Autopoietic Core Updater
  Self-reflexive rewiring based on internal anomaly signatures

---

### **\[Layer 2] Function-Level Primitives**

> *Precise atomic functions invoked by architectural modules.*

* `compute_bdm_curvature()`
* `extract_fim_spectrum()`
* `measure_loop_energy()`
* `track_motif_reorg()`
* `get_token_attribution_path()`
* `compare_compression_ratio()`
* `trigger_autopoietic_rewire()`
* `detect_torsion_instability()`

(Implementations should follow `ci7_<module>_<function>` naming for code.)

---

### **\[Layer 3] Domain-Specific Deployments**

> *End-user or client-facing solutions, experiments, or pipelines built from Layer 1 & 2.*

* `CIv7-SBD` — Structural Break Detection
  Breakpoint discovery via latent geometry shifts

* `CIv7-TI` — Thematic Intelligence
  Latent theme extraction and MDL-guided motif tracking

* `CIv7-SYNTH` — Synthetic Data Engine
  Generative modeling via boundary-breaking symbolic probes

* `CIv7-FI` — Financial Intelligence
  Alpha discovery, regime change, causal inference in markets

* `CIv7-RDM` — Regulatory Decision Modeling
  Policy simulation via constraint-aware counterfactual generation

---

**Next Steps:**

* Validate and revise Layer 1 module names and ensure 1:1 correspondence with functional areas in CIv7 documentation
* Extend this taxonomy into visual dependency graphs
* Identify which modules/components are:

  * Public and open-source
  * Collaboration-ready with attribution
  * Patentable or restricted IP
