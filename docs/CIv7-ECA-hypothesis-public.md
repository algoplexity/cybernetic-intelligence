**Title:** CIv7-ECA Hypothesis: Symbolic Substrate Compression and Fault Geometry in Algorithmic Systems

---

**Abstract:**

The CIv7-ECA Hypothesis proposes that structured symbolic substrates, such as Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA), can serve as interpretable and expressive representations of system dynamics for the purpose of structural break detection, synthetic data generation, and cognitive modeling. It builds on a foundation of algorithmic information theory, compression-based reasoning, and symbolic evolution to uncover latent discontinuities in observed or generated time series data.

**1. Motivation and Core Assumption**

Modern machine learning systems often lack interpretability and adaptability in the face of regime shifts or epistemic uncertainty. CIv7-ECA addresses this by using symbolic, compressible substrates that can evolve autonomously and highlight points of structural change.

* Symbolic compression is treated as a proxy for model understanding.
* Changes in the symbolic motif space correspond to breakpoints in the underlying data-generating process.

---

**2. Hypothesis Statement**

> Structural breaks can be identified as algorithmic discontinuities in the symbolic compression landscape, where the evolution of motifs encoded in ECA substrates fails to compress or reconstruct future states.

---

**3. Key Components**

* **Symbolic Substrate**: Encoded representations (e.g., permutations, delta-signs) of time series mapped to binary strings.
* **ECA Dynamics**: Rule-based evolution of binary strings over time; rules selected to maximize compressibility and minimize description length.
* **Compression Measurement**: Utilizes algorithmic complexity measures such as BDM (Block Decomposition Method) to track motif stability.
* **Break Detection**: Triggered when motifs collapse, rearrange, or show discontinuous increases in algorithmic complexity.

---

**4. Observables and Signals**

* Spike in BDM or algorithmic complexity.
* Disappearance of dominant motifs.
* Sudden increase in the number of minimal programs required.

---

**5. Applications**

* Structural break detection in financial time series
* Synthetic data generation under uncertainty
* Interpretable modeling of symbolic cognition and anomaly detection
