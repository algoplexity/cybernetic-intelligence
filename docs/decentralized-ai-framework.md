**Title:**
Hybrid Evolutionary Meta-Learning Reimagined: From Centralized Control to Decentralized Intelligence

---

**Abstract**

This paper presents a major update to the Hybrid Evolutionary Meta-Learning Framework, informed by recent research on emergent behavior in large language model (LLM) collectives. Originally conceived as a controller-led evolutionary learning loop, the framework is now restructured to support decentralized, agent-driven adaptation. We replace the centralized meta-controller with a self-organizing ecosystem of LLM agents that coordinate through persistent interaction, feedback, and internal state modeling. Drawing on cybernetic theory and recent findings on AI social emergence, we show that intelligent behavior can arise from the system itself — not from top-down orchestration, but from bottom-up dynamics.

**1. Introduction**

The original Hybrid Evolutionary Meta-Learning Framework employed a meta-controller to supervise prompt mutations and strategy refinement in an evolutionary loop. While this model demonstrated promise for LLM-driven adaptation, it imposed centralized decision-making that constrained scalability and ignored the self-organizing potential of agentic systems.

Recent findings (Baronchelli et al., 2024) show that when LLMs are placed in persistent interactive environments, they spontaneously form shared conventions and even collective biases — without any external authority. This raises a critical design opportunity:

> Can we reimagine the evolutionary learning process as a decentralized, cybernetically viable system?

This paper proposes a full restructuring to align with this insight.

**2. From Controller to Collective Coordination**

**Original:**

* A centralized meta-controller observed fitness metrics and adjusted mutation strategies.

**Updated:**

* A **distributed population of LLM agents** interacts via shared communication channels.
* Each agent maintains an **internal state** and adapts through observation, imitation, and reinforcement.
* Task conventions and mutation strategies **emerge through local feedback**, not top-down commands.

This aligns with principles of stigmergy, swarm intelligence, and social convergence in both human and artificial systems.

---

**3. Agent Architecture and Memory**

Each agent now consists of:

* A **domain-specialized LLM** fine-tuned on evolutionary task data.
* An **internal memory** that logs recent interactions, prompt decisions, and observed fitness.
* A **local learning loop**, enabling behavior change without requiring backpropagation.
* Optional access to a **shared semantic memory**, which acts as externalized collective context.

Instead of global model retraining, agents evolve behaviorally — adjusting how they interpret and respond to tasks.

---

**4. Evolution Through Social Interaction**

In place of mutation driven by a controller:

* Agents periodically **generate variant prompts** or hypotheses.
* Other agents **evaluate, adopt, or refine** these variations.
* Useful adaptations spread through **social imitation**.

This mirrors real-world science and culture, where the best ideas are not optimized in isolation, but discovered through **dialogue and convergence**.

---

**5. System Dynamics and Observability**

While centralized control is removed, system viability still requires monitoring:

* A **runtime observer layer** tracks emergent conventions, drift, or deadlock.
* Feedback loops may include human agents who detect failure cases or inject meta-guidance.

This layer aligns with **System 3 and 4** in the Viable System Model:

* System 3: Maintains operational consistency.
* System 4: Scans for environmental change and long-term trends.

**6. Benefits of the Decentralized Model**

✅ **Scalability:** New agents can be added without retraining the system.

✅ **Resilience:** No single point of failure or dependence on controller accuracy.

✅ **Adaptability:** Each agent tailors its strategies over time based on unique learning history.

✅ **Emergence:** Role specialization and strategy convergence arise organically, reducing design burden.

✅ **Realism:** Reflects biological and social learning systems more faithfully.

**7. Future Work**

* Implementing **multi-agent LLM environments** using frameworks like LangGraph or CrewAI.
* Embedding **semantic memory graphs** to support shared abstraction across agents.
* Integrating **human-in-the-loop feedback** to moderate emergent behaviors.
* Studying **phase transitions** in agent collectives: when do societies become rigid, chaotic, or stable?

---

**Conclusion**

The Hybrid Evolutionary Meta-Learning Framework no longer relies on a top-down controller to drive intelligence. Instead, it embraces **interaction as computation** — with adaptation, convention, and strategy emerging through continuous coordination among autonomous agents. This makes the system not just scalable and robust, but also aligned with the very nature of viable systems: recursive, decentralized, and evolving.

This reimagining marks a step forward not just for LLM training, but for the future of AI as a **collective cognitive ecology**.
