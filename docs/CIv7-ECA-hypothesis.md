### **CIv7-ECA: Symbolic Substrate Compression and Fault Geometry in Algorithmic Systems**

#### **Hypothesis**

Complex systems can be understood and diagnosed by encoding temporal or spatial sequences into symbolic representations (e.g., delta-signs, permutation sequences), evolving these through Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA), and analysing the resulting 2D symbolic evolution as a **causally expressive substrate**. This symbolic substrate makes observable the emergence, collapse, and mutation of structures—revealing failure modes or discontinuities as **algorithmic, geometric, and semantic phase transitions**.

These transitions are not limited to any one domain. They may manifest in:

* Time series (e.g., structural breaks)
* Graph dynamics (e.g., motif degeneracy)
* LLM-guided code evolution
* Self-reflective symbolic agents
* Perception-to-imagination overlays in human-AI cognition

ECA-based symbolic substrates, as deterministic rule-based expanders of semantic signal, make **fault geometry and algorithmic misalignment visible and measurable**. We posit that **symbolic motif evolution** via fixed ECA rules forms an interpretable diagnostic plane over which discontinuities appear as phase shifts, compressibility divergences, and topological inflections.

### **Distinguished Application: Structural Break Detection**

Structural breaks in univariate time series can be robustly detected by:

* **Symbolically encoding** the series (e.g., delta-signs, permutation entropy)
* **Evolving** the sequences through Class IV ECAs
* **Analysing** the resulting symbolic 2D evolution for latent fault geometry

Discontinuities manifest as:

* Sudden changes in **algorithmic compressibility** (via BDM or CTM)
* Local **semantic motif rewiring**
* Fault lines traced via **torsion**, **entropy gradients**, or **symbolic attractor collapse**

### **Discontinuities as Phase Shifts in Symbolic Substrate**

Key transition signatures include:

* Algorithmic compressibility shift (BDM/CTM/entropy gradient)
* Joint compression failure between adjacent symbolic segments (Sutskever)
* Collapse of motif circuits and symbolic attractor basins
* Torsional bifurcation (Walch): topological instability under semantic perturbation
* Rewiring of symbolic attention flows (in analogy to Circuit Tracer)
* Local motif entropy spikes or symmetry folds (Grosse et al.)
* Bifurcations and edge-of-chaos attractor instabilities (Zhang et al.)
* Perception-imagination confusion signals (Dijkstra et al.)
* Simulability divergence in symbolic world models (Ha & Schmidhuber)
* Latent steering irreliability analogs in symbolic motif shifts (Braun et al.)
* MCMC layer temperature collapse analogs in symbolic phase shifts (Vivier-Ardisson et al.)
* Negative complexity emergence in degenerate motif zones
* Universal geometry leakage and motif projection drift (Jha et al.)
* Substrate collapse under symbolic agent self-modification (Darwin Gödel Machine)
* Motif classifier failure under category compression vs. semantic fidelity (Shani et al.)
* Failure of symbolic curriculum stability under hybrid SFT-RL learning (SASR)

### **Rationale and Theoretical Foundations**

* **Compression is Prediction** (Sutskever): Symbolic substrates act as joint compressors; failure to compress adjacent regions signals regime change.
* **Algorithmic Complexity** (Sakabe, Zenil): Symbolic evolution under ECA rules yields robust estimates of local information content, superior to Shannon entropy.
* **Torsion** (Walch): A sensitive indicator of latent topological stress; local symbolic torsion marks instability zones.
* **Circuit Drift Analogy** (Anthropic): Semantic attention drift in LLMs has symbolic analogs in motif reconfiguration over time.
* **Negative Complexity** (Grosse): Low-complexity symbolic zones can suddenly destabilise under symmetry breakage.
* **Reality Signal** (Dijkstra): Symbolic motifs sometimes mimic imagined, not real, patterns—leading to symbolic hallucinations.
* **Edge of Chaos** (Zhang): Class IV ECAs provide maximally informative symbolic dynamics—structured enough to encode causality, chaotic enough to surface meaningful divergence.
* **World Models** (Ha & Schmidhuber): Symbolic ECA evolution provides an alternate substrate for generative modeling and mismatch detection.
* **vec2vec Leakage** (Jha): Symbolic motifs exhibit cross-architecture alignment potential—vulnerable to projection drift and causality loss.
* **Langlands Duality** (Hodge): Transformers encode geometric-algebraic duality; symbolic substrates externalise this as motif attractor duality.
* **Steering Vector Failure** (Braun et al.): Symbolic motifs resist coherent steering when their local evolution manifolds lose separability or directional alignment—analogous to latent vector drift in LLMs.
