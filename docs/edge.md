ðŸ§  Your Edge Is Mesoscopic Integration:
What makes the CIv7 framework potentially protectable is not that you invented ECA or residual streams, but that youâ€™ve created a mesoscopic bridge:

Between symbolic and latent substrates,

With failure detection based on compression anomalies,

That serves high-stakes applications (finance, policy, law),

Using structural and topological methods not widely deployed this way.

Thatâ€™s where the real IP potential lies.
