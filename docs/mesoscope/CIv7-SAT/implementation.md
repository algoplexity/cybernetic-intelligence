Great ‚Äî let‚Äôs begin by systematically mapping the key research references to each functional requirement of the CIv7-SAT module, followed by a stepwise, evidence-backed implementation plan. The CIv7-SAT module is designed to detect, localize, and attribute semantic drift or structural faults in LLM outputs by analyzing attention patterns, attribution pathways, and their evolution over time.

## üîß Stepwise CIv7-SAT Implementation Plan

Each step maps to the above functionality and is justified by one or more references.

### **Step 1: Token Attribution Path Extraction**

**Goal:** For each input token, trace its contribution to the output using attention maps and/or gradient-based attribution.

* Use transformer attention weights or integrated gradients to compute per-token influence.
* Store `Dict[str, List[float]]` of token ‚Üî influence across heads/layers.
* Reference: *Anthropic Circuit Tracer*; *Braun et al.*

```python
def get_token_attribution_path(input_tokens: List[str], model_outputs: Any) -> Dict[str, List[float]]:
    # Use captum or custom layer-wise relevance propagation
```

---

### **Step 2: Baseline Attention Pattern Storage**

**Goal:** For known clean data (pre-alignment), store canonical attention patterns as drift reference.

* Capture mean attention per head across clean inputs.
* Reference: *Hodge et al.* on stable attention topology; *Sutskever* on shared structure

```python
baseline_attention = np.mean(attention_matrices, axis=0)  # shape: [layers, heads, tokens, tokens]
```

---

### **Step 3: Attention Shift Metric**

**Goal:** Quantify how much an attention matrix has changed from the baseline (KL divergence, cosine similarity, etc.)

* Apply per-head cosine/KL similarity
* Use early warning thresholds (e.g., >0.2 cosine drift = alert)
* Reference: *CoT Monitoring*; *Shani et al.*

```python
def track_attention_shift(current_attention: np.ndarray, baseline_attention: np.ndarray) -> float:
    return cosine_similarity(current_attention.flatten(), baseline_attention.flatten())
```

---

### **Step 4: Attribution Geometry Diagnostics**

**Goal:** Evaluate the distribution and separability of concept vectors or activation clusters.

* Use PCA, UMAP, or torsion measures on hidden states.
* Detect vector collapse, merge, or drift.
* Reference: *Walch & Hodge*; *Grosse et al.*

```python
def evaluate_latent_geometry(hidden_states: np.ndarray) -> Dict[str, float]:
    # Calculate cluster separability, torsion, rank
```

---

### **Step 5: Localize Drift Sources**

**Goal:** Identify attention heads, layers, or rules causing semantic drift.

* Build influence graph using changes in attention + activation similarity
* Use BDM (Sakabe et al.) on symbolic input/output sequences if applicable
* Reference: *Anthropic Circuit Tracer*; *Sakabe et al.*; *Gr√ºnwald & Roos*

---

### **Step 6: Align Attribution Drift with Output Errors**

**Goal:** Detect cases where semantic drift aligns with known failure patterns (hallucination, obfuscation, collapse).

* Correlate attribution deltas with behavioral failures
* Reference: *OpenAI Reward Hacking*; *Shani et al.*

---

### **Step 7: Monitoring Dashboard and Logging**

**Goal:** Provide live, trackable metrics across training/serving stages.

* Attribution heatmaps
* Attention divergence over time
* Causal fingerprint diffs
* Alert system for drift

---

## üìå Summary

The implementation of CIv7-SAT is grounded in strong theoretical and empirical support:

* **Conceptual Cores:** Attribution ‚â† explanation, drift is structural, not just statistical.
* **Empirical Foundations:** Multiple works support that attention, latent geometry, and output alignment failures can be monitored causally.
* **Diagnostic Angle:** Combines symbolic and numerical diagnostics (BDM + attribution graphs).
