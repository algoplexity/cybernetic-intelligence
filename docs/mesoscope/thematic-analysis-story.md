| **Latent Steering Drift**             | Toma                  | Quiet vector analyst + Reflective Mirror     | Latent (LLM)      | Tracks inconsistency in directional activation vectors during motif generation or theme summarization | Reveals unreliability in steering toward consistent thematic outputs; early indicator of hallucination or prompt failure     |
| **Joint Compression Divergence**      | Lina + Toma           | Shared view through Bowl and Mirror          | Symbolic + Latent | Compares encoding of source text and summary in latent space; detects mutual compression failure      | Detects when summaries fail to preserve joint structure with source text, exposing thematic collapse or distortion           |
| **Motif Cohesion Collapse**           | Lina                  | Rhythmic motif listener + Resonant Bowl      | Symbolic (ECA)    | Identifies when recurring motifs lose representational consistency across prompts or subtopics        | Highlights degeneration of key thematic patterns, especially in long-form summarization or clustering                        |
| **Circuit Dissociation Mapping**      | Toma                  | Reflective Mirror tracing attention circuits | Latent (LLM)      | Tracks rewiring of attention roles over time or across similar inputs                                 | Surfaces internal instability in thematic reasoning—where attention “jumps” cause semantic role misalignment                 |
| **Compression Ratio Instability**     | Lina                  | Rhythm and coherence seeker                  | Symbolic (ECA)    | Measures how compressibility changes across layers or stages of prompting                             | Detects overcompression or undercompression that causes loss of thematic granularity                                         |
| **Semantic Attractor Shift**          | Ori                   | Intuitive listener + Sensory Vest            | Cross-modal       | Monitors resonance of multiple thematic interpretations; detects attractor basin instability          | Detects when meaning collapses into overly simplistic or incorrect interpretations—especially in multi-perspective reasoning |
| **KL-Divergence Spike Monitor**       | Toma                  | Statistical observer + Reflective overlay    | Latent (LLM)      | Monitors spike in divergence between expected and actual latent distributions post-summary            | Flags abrupt conceptual drifts in summary, contrastive responses, or long-sequence thematic fidelity                         |
| **Prompt-Response Misalignment Scan** | Lina + Toma           | Joint semantic fidelity check                | Symbolic + Latent | Compares encoding of prompt and response in latent space to detect compression asymmetry              | Detects dissonance between query intent and generated thematic output                                                        |
| **Latent Bifurcation Tracker**        | Toma                  | Divergence-aware analyst                     | Latent (LLM)      | Detects emergence of incompatible activation paths under slightly varied prompts                      | Surfaces latent instability across question formats, leading to inconsistent theme labelling                                 |
| **Theme Leakage Mapper**              | Ori                   | Sensitive coherence detector + Sensory Vest  | Cross-modal       | Detects unintentional motif emergence in unrelated contexts, indicating latent leakage                | Flags conceptual interference or hidden motif reuse that pollutes thematic purity                                            |
