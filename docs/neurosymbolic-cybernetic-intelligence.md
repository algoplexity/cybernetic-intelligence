# **Unified Cybernetic Intelligence Hypothesis (CIv13–15)**

### **Hypothesis Statement**

The system operates as a **progressively adaptive, neurosymbolic cybernetic intelligence**, evolving from **regime detection** (CIv13) → **dynamic modeling** (CIv14) → **autopoietic planning** (CIv15). Intelligence is defined as **algorithmic compression coupled with predictive capability**, operationalized via **symbolic-latent divergence**, **BDM/MDL-complexity monitoring**, and **φ-scored minimal generative programs**. The system self-adapts, forecasts, and interacts with external agents, achieving interpretable, robust, and self-maintaining behavior across increasing sequence complexity.

## **Stepwise Implementation Roadmap**

### **Step 1 – CIv13: Symbolic-Latent Divergence Detection**

**Objective:** Detect structural breaks/regime changes in sequences.

* **Substrate Engagement:**

  * Symbolic: Extracts minimal generative programs from sequences (Riedel & Zenil, 2025).
  * Latent: Encodes compressed statistical dynamics via TSEncoder/Transformer (Burtsev et al., 2023).
  * Unified: Measures divergence between symbolic and latent streams.

* **Mechanism:**

  * Compute ΔBDM and ΔMDL for sequence segments.
  * Signal a regime change if thresholds θ\_BDM or θ\_MDL exceeded.
  * Generate φ-scored sketches (Non-Print & Non-Ordinal prioritized).

* **Metrics:**

  * ΔBDM, ΔMDL, divergence magnitude, regime detection recall, φ output ratio.

### **Step 2 – CIv14: Dynamic Viability & Forecasting**

**Objective:** Extend detection to **modeling, adaptation, and interpretable forecasting**.

* **Substrate Engagement:**

  * Symbolic: Maintains minimal generative programs; outputs φ-scored sketches.
  * Latent: Continues compressing sequences; tracks ΔBDM, ΔMDL, and forecast error.
  * Unified: Integrates decompressor forecaster with symbolic-latent divergence for regime probability.

* **Mechanism:**

  * Use decompression of symbolic sketches to predict next sequence windows.
  * Combine divergence signals with ΔBDM/ΔMDL to forecast regimes.
  * Communicate φ ≥ φ\_min outputs to analysts/agents.

* **Metrics:**

  * Forecast MSE, regime probability, φ-score distribution, compression efficiency (ΔBDM gain), internal consistency (ΔMDL stabilization).

  * Maturana & Varela, 1980 – Autopoiesis (applied to internal adaptation).
  * Ashby, 1956 – Cybernetic feedback principles.

### **Step 3 – CIv15: Autopoietic Planning & Self-Evolution**

**Objective:** Enable **self-maintaining, recursive adaptation**, integrating planning and action selection.

* **Substrate Engagement:**

  * Symbolic: Programs become self-editing; stored in versioned program library.
  * Latent: Provides compressed pattern feedback post-edit; evaluates impact of program modifications.
  * Unified: Controller orchestrates autopoietic loop: symbolic edits + latent monitoring + decompression forecasts → action selection.

* **Mechanism:**

  * Evaluate candidate program edits via ΔMDL, φ, and utility function U = f(ΔBDM, forecast accuracy, domain-specific reward).
  * Simulate forward outcomes using decompressor forecaster; select actions maximizing U.
  * Perturb programs for causal robustness; accept edits improving forecast, compressibility, or utility.

* **Metrics:**

  * Autopoietic viability: ΔMDL ≤ 0, MSE improving.
  * Compression efficiency: ΔBDM positive post-edit.
  * Action utility: U maximized.
  * Adaptability: φ outputs ≥ φ\_min across curriculum levels.
  * Robust recovery post-perturbation: return to stable ΔMDL/ΔBDM.

### **Step 4 – Integrated Curriculum & Complexity Escalation**

**Objective:** Ensure the system generalizes across increasing sequence complexity and domains.

* **Mechanism:**

  * Generate sequences of escalating complexity (climber → random → domain-transfer).
  * Continuously evaluate symbolic φ outputs and latent ΔBDM/ΔMDL.
  * Adjust program library and forecaster parameters iteratively.

* **Metrics:**

  * Curriculum adaptability: φ ≥ φ\_min across all levels.
  * Forecast retention: MSE consistent across sequence complexity.
  * Compression trend: ΔBDM growth proportional to complexity increase.

### **Step 5 – External Agent Integration**

**Objective:** Enable **meaningful interaction with analysts, stakeholders, or other agents**, feeding actionable insights.

* **Mechanism:**

  * Export φ-scored symbolic sketches and forecasts.
  * Provide regime probabilities, compression-based confidence scores, and suggested interventions.
  * Allow external feedback to influence internal program edits and latent representations.

* **Metrics:**

  * Human/agent interpretability: fraction of outputs with φ ≥ φ\_min.
  * Intervention effectiveness: improvement in forecast accuracy or compression after external input.
  * Adaptive learning: measurable ΔBDM/ΔMDL improvement post-feedback.

* **Citations:**

  * Ashby, 1956 – Cybernetic control loops.

### **Key Notes**

1. Each step **builds incrementally**:

   * Step 1 → detection
   * Step 2 → dynamic modeling
   * Step 3 → self-maintenance and planning
   * Step 4 → curriculum-driven generalization
   * Step 5 → external interaction
2. Substrate engagement **progressively integrates symbolic, latent, and unified layers**, culminating in CIv15’s autopoietic loop.
3. All measurable signals (ΔBDM, ΔMDL, φ, forecast MSE, utility) provide **implementation-ready metrics**.
