## CIv4+5 Hypothesis v2.1: Reality Signal for Structural Break Detection

### Background

Within the CIv4+5 framework, viable agents maintain intelligence through recursive coordination between perception, simulation, and model evolution. In v1.0, we proposed that a cyber-physical agent operates via a layered architecture of symbolic compression, motif induction, and coordination loops grounded in algorithmic information dynamics.

This v2.1 module focuses on a specific refinement: **how the agent detects misalignment between its internal model and external environment**, signaling a structural break or regime shift. The mechanism we introduce is the **Reality Signal (RS)**.

### Core Proposition

The **Reality Signal (RS)** is a latent variable that encodes the alignment between internally simulated states and externally observed data. It serves as the decision variable for structural coherence within the agentâ€™s world model. When RS drops below a threshold, the agent classifies the situation as a structural break, triggering model evolution or control reconfiguration.

This module thus addresses a fundamental cybernetic problem: *how does a system distinguish hallucination from grounded prediction?*

### RS Definition (Cyber-Physical Formulation)

For a system with internal simulation $\hat{x}_t$ and external observation $x_t$:

$$
\text{RS}(t) = -\text{BDM}(x_t \oplus \hat{x}_t) + \lambda \cdot \text{BDM}(\hat{x}_t)
$$

* $x_t$: observed state at time $t$
* $\hat{x}_t$: predicted or simulated state at time $t$
* $\oplus$: symbolic difference or structural mismatch operator
* $\text{BDM}(\cdot)$: Block Decomposition Method complexity
* $\lambda$: complexity regularization coefficient

### Thresholding and Adaptation

A dynamic thresholding mechanism maps RS to adaptive decisions:

* **High RS**: reality-aligned â€” maintain mode
* **Low RS**: potential break â€” initiate control transition or rule update
* **RS drops**: log breakpoint and invoke re-coordination

This mirrors how the human brainâ€™s frontal regions transform continuous perceptual signals into binary judgments about reality (Dijkstra et al., 2025).

### Minimal Validation: Univariate Prototype

We validate this mechanism in a simplified testbed: a single univariate time series. In this setting:

* RS is computed as the rolling divergence between observed and predicted values.
* A breakpoint is declared when RS(t) falls below a learned or adaptive threshold.
* This allows comparison against statistical methods (e.g., CUSUM, BOCPD) and grounding for rule evolution (e.g., AlphaEvolve).

### Role Within the CIv4+5 Architecture

Within the full CIv4+5 system, RS serves as:

* A control signal for **Coordination Layer** switching
* A trigger for **Structural Break Detector** modules
* A feedback variable in **AlphaEvolve** for rule refinement
* An anomaly gate for **Narrative Integrity** checks in higher-level semantic models

The RS formalism is designed to generalize across scales: from binary motif streams to multidimensional economic indicators, from symbolic simulations to embodied telemetry.

### Summary

CIv4+5 v2.1 introduces the **Reality Signal** as a modular refinement: a real-time measure of simulation-perception alignment that drives structural break detection. RS enables a viable system to monitor its own predictive realism and reconfigure in the face of divergence â€” an essential mechanism for cybernetic adaptation.
