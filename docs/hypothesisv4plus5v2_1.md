## CIv4+5 Hypothesis v2.1: Cybernetic Intelligence and the Reality Signal

### Background
Traditional AI models often operate under rigid assumptions about the separation between simulation and perception, model and world. However, emerging insights from both cognitive neuroscience and cyber-physical system design suggest that a more viable, adaptive form of intelligence must continuously monitor and recalibrate its alignment with reality.

### Core Proposition
**Cybernetic Intelligence version 4+5 (CIv4+5)** posits that a viable agent — human or machine — maintains intelligence through *continuous comparison between internal simulation and external perception*, dynamically updating its operational mode in response to discrepancies. The central mechanism enabling this is a latent variable we define as the **Reality Signal (RS)**.

### Reality Signal (RS)
The RS is a real-time measure of alignment between internal model outputs and real-world observations. In cognitive systems, this signal is tracked in the mid-level visual cortex (fusiform gyrus), as demonstrated in Dijkstra et al. (2025). In cyber-physical systems, we define RS computationally as follows:

#### RS Definition (Cyber-Physical Formulation)

For a system with internal simulation \\( \\hat{x}_t \\) and external observation \\( x_t \\):

\\[
\\text{RS}(t) = -\\text{BDM}(x_t \\oplus \\hat{x}_t) + \\lambda \\cdot \\text{BDM}(\\hat{x}_t)
\\]

- \\( x_t \\): observed state at time \\( t \\)  
- \\( \\hat{x}_t \\): predicted or simulated state at time \\( t \\)  
- \\( \\oplus \\): symbolic difference or structural mismatch operator  
- \\( \\text{BDM}(\\cdot) \\): Block Decomposition Method complexity measure  
- \\( \\lambda \\): regularization parameter controlling complexity penalty  

The RS is computed over a sliding window and can be smoothed to yield \\( \\text{RS}_w(t) \\) for stability.

### Thresholding and Adaptation

A **dynamic thresholding mechanism** maps RS to categorical judgments:

- **High RS** → alignment with reality — maintain course  
- **Low RS** → divergence — potential structural break  
- **Threshold crossings** → trigger mode switching, model updates, or cybernetic coordination loop adaptation

This mirrors the brain’s transformation of continuous perceptual signals into binary reality judgments via regions like the anterior insula and dmPFC.

### Minimal Viable Environment: Univariate Time Series

To validate this hypothesis, we begin in a controlled environment with a single univariate time series. Here, RS is calculated as the rolling divergence between predicted and observed values, with structural breaks identified when RS drops below a learned or adaptive threshold.

This minimal setup allows:
- Empirical testing of RS dynamics
- Comparison against traditional statistical break detectors
- Evaluation of model evolution mechanisms (e.g., AlphaEvolve)

---

### Broader Implications

Once validated, the RS mechanism generalizes to multivariate settings, hierarchical rule inference, and high-dimensional control environments. It offers a unified principle for reality monitoring across:

- Financial forecasting and alpha generation  
- Narrative coherence in policy modeling  
- Self-modeling agents in law, health, and safety contexts

---

### Summary

CIv4+5 Hypothesis v2.1 formalizes the **Reality Signal (RS)** as a central variable in cyber-physical intelligence. By continuously assessing alignment between internal simulation and external data, RS enables systems to detect structural breaks, adaptively re-coordinate, and maintain viability in dynamic environments.
