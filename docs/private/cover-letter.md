**Re: Application for Master of Applied Cybernetics**

Dear Members of the Selection Panel,

I am excited to apply for the Master of Applied Cybernetics program at ANU. My career spans over two decades across technology, finance, research, and public service, unified by a passion for designing adaptive systems that are both technically robust and socially responsible. Most recently, as a Graduate Data Scientist at the Attorney-General’s Department, I have delivered advanced analytical insights to inform policy and organisational improvement, including leading sentiment analysis of the 2024–2025 Employee Census to identify emerging workplace issues and improvements.

I bring a strong track record of intellectual leadership, from MSc research applying algorithmic information theory to stock market dynamics, to architecting enterprise integration platforms processing 100+ requests per second, to publishing frameworks linking agility with diversity, equity, and inclusion. Across these roles, I have translated complexity into clarity for audiences ranging from government executives to community stakeholders, often bridging technical and non-technical domains.

My work reflects flexibility, calculated risk-taking, and resilience — shifting between enterprise architecture, quantitative finance, and public sector data science while thriving in uncertain, fast-changing environments. Cybernetics underpins my approach, enabling me to collaborate across engineering, social science, policy, and environmental science, and to design interventions that balance efficiency, adaptability, and ethics.

Beyond my professional roles, I have mobilised community-led sustainability initiatives and contributed to human rights advocacy through the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, reinforcing my mission-driven mindset and commitment to equitable, ethical impact.

The Master of Applied Cybernetics offers the opportunity to formalise and extend my ability to lead in socio-technical systems at scale. I am eager to contribute my technical expertise, collaborative ethos, and interdisciplinary experience to the program’s pioneering learning community. A **Selection Criteria Mapping Table** is attached as an appendix for your reference.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,

This version keeps everything to **under one page** while still clearly addressing each selection theme and pointing the panel to the mapping table for detailed evidence.

If you’d like, I can also **draft a polished “portfolio piece” summary** that complements both the cover letter and mapping table so your application package feels fully integrated. That would complete the Stage One requirements in a cohesive way.
