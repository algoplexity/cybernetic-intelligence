CAREER PROFILE
Multidisciplinary data scientist, software developer, and quantitative researcher with a track record of applying advanced analytics, machine learning, and systems thinking to complex problems in finance, enterprise technology, and the public sector. My career spans architecting scalable enterprise platforms, conducting algorithmic trading research, and, most recently, delivering actionable insights for government decision-making as a Graduate Data Scientist at the Attorney-Generalâ€™s Department. I combine deep technical expertise in algorithmic information theory, statistical modelling, and enterprise systems architecture with a human-centred approach to data analysis, producing evidence-based insights that inform strategy, optimise performance, and support cultural and organisational improvement. Passionate about bridging technical rigour with real-world impact, I thrive in environments where interdisciplinary thinking, innovation, and continuous learning drive meaningful outcomes.
