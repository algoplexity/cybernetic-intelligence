The **public version of the CIv7-ECA Hypothesis** deliberately omits or abstracts several implementation-specific and proprietary elements to protect the intellectual property core. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what was **omitted**, **why**, and how they map to your internal architecture:

### üîê Omitted Details and Rationale

| **Omitted Detail**                                                                          | **Why It‚Äôs Omitted**                                                                                     | **Where It Belongs (Private Layer)** |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Exact ECA rule set** (e.g., Class IV tuples, Rule 110 with torsion logic)                 | Reveals the symbolic substrate used for internal representation modeling; core to compression+generation | `CIv7-ECA:MotifCore`                 |
| **Motif encoding format** (permutation-encoded binary strings, symbolic deltas, etc.)       | Gives away how raw data is abstracted for compression and comparison                                     | `CIv7-ECA:SymbolicEncoder`           |
| **Sliding window compression regime switcher**                                              | Proprietary logic for detecting when motif patterns reorganize                                           | `CIv7-ECA:BreakDetector`             |
| **Entropy tracking and torsion monitors**                                                   | Key geometric invariants used in regime classification and failure mode analysis                         | `CIv7-Core:GeometrySensors`          |
| **BDM application specifics** (parameterization, motif structure embedding, storage/recall) | BDM use is disclosed, but not *how* it interacts with motif evolution and rewiring                       | `CIv7-ECA:MDLEngine`                 |
| **Integration with autopoietic rewiring loop**                                              | Discloses internal symbolic self-repair and concept attractor reformation                                | `CIv7-Core:AutopoieticSystem`        |
| **Cross-model alignment mechanisms**                                                        | Leaves out motif alignment, vec2vec projection, and symbolic concept drift detection                     | `CIv7-Framework:AlignmentEngine`     |

### üîç What‚Äôs Still in the Public Version (and Why)

* **Scientific grounding** (e.g., use of Kolmogorov complexity, BDM, symbolic automata)
* **Motivation for ECA**: Universality, interpretability, symbolic dynamics under uncertainty
* **General pipeline logic**: Transform raw text/signal into motifs ‚Üí compress ‚Üí detect failures
* **References to literature** (Sutskever, Zenil, Sakabe, Grosse, Langlands, etc.)
* **Framing of structural break detection** as sensitivity to compressive instability
* **High-level module labels** without exposing the internal dataflows

This ensures clarity for researchers, regulators, or collaborators *without compromising proprietary implementation*.
