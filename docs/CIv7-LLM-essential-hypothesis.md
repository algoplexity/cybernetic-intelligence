## üß† **CIv7-LLM: Latent Fault Geometry via Compression-Aligned Failure Surfaces in Language Models**

### Version: CIv7-LLM v1.0

**Hypothesis:**
Intelligence requires a **latent substrate** that maintains semantic and conceptual continuity across context. When this continuity breaks‚Äîmanifesting as hallucination, attention collapse, or reasoning drift‚Äîthose breakdowns trace **fault geometries** in the latent space. These fault lines are identifiable through the **failure of internal compression** within the latent substrate, revealing misalignments between attention flow, residual representation, and causal coherence.

---

### üî¨ Mechanism:

* The latent substrate is defined by **residual streams**, **attention heads**, and **layer activations** in transformer-based architectures such as LLMs.
* It encodes **implicit conceptual structure** by distributing meaning across **high-dimensional latent manifolds**.
* These manifolds are organized by **causal token prediction** under a locally compressive regime (via entropy minimization, next-token predictability).
* **Compression-aligned inference** implies that each next-token prediction refines the internal manifold towards **conceptual stability**.
* **Faults** arise when the latent substrate fails to compress prior context meaningfully‚Äîdetected as:

  * Concept drift across layers
  * Attention collapse (flat or misaligned attention patterns)
  * Incoherent CoT (Chain of Thought) expansions
  * Disrupted residual accumulation or vector divergence

---

### üß© Role of the Latent Substrate:

* The latent substrate acts as a **semantic field**: a distributed representational surface shaped by past tokens, internal attention routing, and positional embeddings.
* Its role is to **sustain semantic continuity** over long-range dependencies without explicit symbolic tracking.
* It "remembers" not as discrete motifs but as **entangled gradients** of conceptual expectations.

---

### üß† Intelligence, in this view, is:

> The capacity to sustain and repair a **compression-aligned latent field** that encodes evolving context, such that when faults emerge, they reveal **where the system stops understanding**.

---

### üß± Supporting Research:

* **Sutskever et al. (2021‚Äì2023)**: Proposed the idea of **joint compression failure** as a method to evaluate whether two representations share latent structure.
* **Shani et al. (2023)**: Showed that LLMs experience **semantic drift** in latent space during long-context decoding; drift aligns with performance collapse.
* **Micha√´l Trazzi, Anthropic (2023)**: Demonstrated that **attention heads specialize in semantic routing**, and disruptions in their alignment correlate with hallucination zones.
* **Braun et al. (2022)**: Introduced the concept of **residual stream curvature**, showing that reasoning chains map onto structured flows through the model‚Äôs latent geometry.
* **Elhage et al. (Transformer Circuits, 2021‚Äì2024)**: Analyzed the internals of transformer models, revealing **mechanistic failures** during CoT reasoning in specific attention heads.

### üåÄ Compression Failure = Conceptual Fault Surface

A latent fault occurs when the model cannot compress its contextual substrate into a coherent next state. Signs of such a fault include:

* **Non-monotonic attention allocation** (e.g. switching topic mid-prompt)
* **Redundant token paths** (copy-paste hallucinations, repetition loops)
* **Divergent residual stream norms** (spikes in internal vector norms across layers)
* **Failed CoT bifurcation** (aborted reasoning traces or contradictory completions)

These surfaces can be **mapped geometrically** using:

* Attention flow vectors
* Residual curvature metrics
* Trajectory divergence in token embeddings

### üß¨ Notation Sketch (Illustrative):

Let:

* `X = [x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, ..., x‚Çô]` be the input token sequence
* `H·µ¢` = attention matrix at layer `i`
* `R·µ¢` = residual stream at layer `i`
* `f·µ¢(R·µ¢)` = transformed representation post-layer `i`
* `L(X) = log P(x‚Çô | x‚ÇÅ...x‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ)` = local compression score

Then:

* **Latent divergence** is measured by `ŒîR = ‚ÄñR·µ¢ - R·µ¢‚Çã‚ÇÅ‚Äñ` across depth
* **Attention collapse** when `H·µ¢ ‚Üí uniform` or `H·µ¢ ‚Üí null`
* **Semantic drift** if `‚àáf·µ¢(R·µ¢)` points orthogonal to previous residual directions
* A **conceptual fault** is flagged when:

  ```
  ‚àÉ i ‚àà layers such that:
    ŒîR > Œ∏‚ÇÅ ‚àß H·µ¢ collapsed ‚àß ‚àáf·µ¢ misaligned ‚àß L(X) degrades
  ```

### üß† Summary:

The **latent substrate** encodes what the model *implicitly knows* but cannot articulate symbolically. When it **fails to compress meaning**, it reveals:

* Faults in internal reasoning structures
* Collapsed or ambiguous causal pathways
* Semantic incoherence not explainable by surface output

Understanding these latent failure surfaces allows us to:

* Detect emergent reasoning failure
* Optimize LLM prompts and training curricula
* Infer where concept learning breaks under pressure
