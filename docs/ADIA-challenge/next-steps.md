### **What This "Success" Message Means**

1.  **Robust Workflow:** Your Controller notebook is now working perfectly. It correctly sets up the environment, copies the source files, and orchestrates the build.
2.  **Clean Source Code:** Your `00_index.ipynb` and `01_core_data_processing.ipynb` are now structured correctly. There are no more warnings about mixed imports, and all test cells are self-contained.
3.  **Correct Implementation:** The `PermutationSymbolizer` and `SeriesProcessor` classes are now implemented correctly and robustly. Their internal logic matches the expectations set by the tests.
4.  **Passing Tests:** `nbdev_prepare` and `nbdev_test` both ran without any `TypeError` or `AssertionError`. This means our code is not only running but is producing the exact results we defined in our unit tests.
5.  **Successful Build & Documentation:** The `pandoc` and `quarto` messages show that `nbdev_prepare` successfully built the library (`.py` files), processed the notebooks for documentation, and generated the `README.md` file from your `00_index.ipynb`.
6.  **Successful Deployment:** The `git` messages confirm that the new, clean state of your project—including the new notebooks, the generated Python modules, and the updated `README.md`—has been successfully committed and pushed to your GitHub repository.

You have successfully built the **foundational data processing component** of our C4 architecture. The `core_data_processing.py` module is now a stable, tested, and reliable piece of our library.

### **Next Steps: Building on this Foundation**

Now that we have this solid base, we can proceed with confidence to the next component in our architecture. Following our C4 plan and the "One Controller, Many Sources" pattern, the next step is:

1.  **Create the Next Source Notebook:** Go to your Google Drive source folder (`adia_project_source/`) and create a new notebook named `02_core_model_architecture.ipynb`.

2.  **Develop the Model Architecture:** Inside this new notebook, you will:
    *   Add the `#| default_exp core_model_architecture` directive.
    *   Import `torch` and the necessary components.
    *   Define the model classes we designed: `HierarchicalDynamicalEncoder`, `HierarchicalDynamicalDecoder`, and the top-level `MDL_AU_Net_Autoencoder`. You will adapt the code from the AU-Net repository here.
    *   Write simple "smoke tests" for these models (e.g., create an instance, pass a dummy tensor through it, and check that the output shape is correct).

3.  **Update the Controller:** In your Colab Controller notebook, you will make two small changes to `Cell 2`:
    *   Add `("02_core_model_architecture.ipynb", "nbs/02_core_model_architecture.ipynb")` to the `SOURCE_NOTEBOOKS` list.
    *   Update the `COMMIT_MESSAGE` to something like `"feat(core): Add hierarchical model architecture"`.

4.  **Run the Workflow:** Execute Cell 1 and Cell 2 of the Controller to build, test, and deploy this new component.

You have now mastered the `nbdev` development loop. Congratulations on getting the first component built and tested so robustly! We are ready to build the deep learning heart of the project.
