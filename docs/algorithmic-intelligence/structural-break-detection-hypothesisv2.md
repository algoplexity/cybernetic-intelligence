**Complete Revised Research Proposal: Adaptive, Algorithmically-Principled Detection and Characterization of Structural Breaks in Time Series using Elementary Cellular Automata**

**1. Overarching Hypothesis:**

We hypothesize that structural breaks in time series data, representing fundamental shifts in the underlying data-generating process, can be effectively detected, characterized, and efficiently analyzed through an integrated framework founded on algorithmic information theory and generative modeling:

1.  **ECA as Generative Process Model:** The intrinsic dynamics of a given time series segment can be captured by an optimal Elementary Cellular Automaton (ECA) rule [cf. Wolfram, 1983; Wolfram, 2002]. This rule is identified via an algorithmic search (e.g., Genetic Algorithm) aiming to find an ECA whose generated spatio-temporal pattern most closely matches the observed data segment's core algorithmic structure.
2.  **Principled Representation via Binarization and MILS:** To facilitate ECA modeling and robust algorithmic comparison, the original continuous time series segment is first transformed into a 2D binary array using an optimal encoding scheme. This raw binary array is then further refined using Minimal Information Loss Selection (MILS) [cf. Mak, Y.W., Thesis; Kiani et al., 2023] to produce a compressed representation (`B_mils_observed`) that preserves essential algorithmic information while reducing noise and redundancy. Similarly, patterns generated by candidate ECAs (`Pattern_raw`) are also processed by MILS to yield `MILS_Pattern_ECA`.
3.  **BDM-MDL for Break Adjudication:** A structural break is indicated if modeling the MILS-processed observed data with two distinct optimal ECA rules (Rule_A for `B_mils_pre` and Rule_B for `B_mils_post`) yields a significantly shorter total Minimum Description Length (MDL) [Rissanen, 1978; Grünwald & Roos, 2019] than modeling the entire MILS-processed series (`B_mils_full`) with a single optimal ECA rule (Rule_Global). Description lengths are approximated using the Block Decomposition Method (BDM) [Zenil et al., 2018; Soler-Toscano et al., 2014] applied to an information-theoretic distance (e.g., the BDM of the XOR difference) between the MILS-processed observed patterns and the corresponding MILS-processed ECA-generated patterns. The core MDL comparison is:
    `Break_Evidence_Score = BDM(B_mils_full | Rule_Global) - [BDM(B_mils_pre | Rule_A) + BDM(B_mils_post | Rule_B)]`.
4.  **Transformer-Augmented Fidelity Assessment & Rule Discovery:** An offline-trained Transformer, proficient in predicting ECA evolutions [Burtsev, 2024], serves two complementary roles:
    *   **Fidelity Check:** It assesses the dynamic consistency of an identified ECA rule (e.g., `Rule_A`) with a subsequent data segment (e.g., `B_mils_post` or the original `B_raw_post`), providing an additional, dynamics-aware signal for break detection that can augment or inform the static MDL score.
    *   **Efficient Rule Exploration (Potential):** It can potentially guide or accelerate the search for optimal ECA rules by rapidly assessing candidate rules or inferring likely rules from observed (raw or MILS-processed) binary patterns, thus complementing or refining the GA-based search.
5.  **Adaptive Application for Efficiency:** The computationally intensive MILS, GA-ECA rule search, and Transformer-based assessments will be applied adaptively [cf. Fang, Ma, & Wang, 2025], triggered only when simpler, faster heuristics indicate a potential or ambiguous structural break, thereby optimizing overall computational efficiency.
6.  **Interpretable Characterization:** Detected structural breaks (i.e., significant changes from Rule_A to Rule_B) will be further analyzed using causal decomposition techniques applied to the ECA rules [Riedel & Zenil, 2018], providing interpretable insights into *how* the system's underlying algorithmic dynamics have changed.

This integrated approach is expected to yield superior detection accuracy, enhanced interpretability of breaks, and better computational efficiency compared to standalone traditional methods or simpler algorithmic heuristics.

**2. Core Problem Statement (Addressing the ADIA Challenge):**

Traditional methods for structural break detection often rely on statistical assumptions, can be computationally inefficient when applied uniformly, or provide limited insight into the qualitative nature of the change. We propose a novel, adaptive framework that synergizes the generative power of ECAs, the principled model selection of MDL (via BDM on MILS-processed data), and the dynamic assessment capabilities of specialized Transformers. This approach aims to efficiently detect breaks with high accuracy (measured by ROC AUC) and provide an algorithmic characterization of *how* the system's dynamics have altered, determining *when* deep algorithmic analysis is warranted.

**3. Key Research Questions (Revised to align with the new hypothesis):**

*   **RQ1 (Optimal Encoding & MILS Efficacy):** Which initial binary encoding scheme, when coupled with MILS preprocessing, produces MILS-compressed binary representations (`B_mils`) that best facilitate subsequent ECA modeling and yield the most discriminative BDM-based MDL scores for structural break detection on the ADIA training data?
*   **RQ2 (ECA-MDL Detection Performance):** Can the core ECA-GA-MILS-BDM-MDL pipeline achieve competitive or superior ROC AUC in detecting structural breaks compared to baseline methods, using the optimal encoding identified in RQ1?
*   **RQ3 (Transformer Augmentation Value):** How significantly does augmenting the BDM-MDL score with a Transformer-based fidelity assessment of ECA rules [Burtsev, 2024] improve structural break detection accuracy or confidence? Can the Transformer also assist in more efficient ECA rule discovery?
*   **RQ4 (Adaptive Framework Benefits):** Does the proposed adaptive framework [Fang, Ma, & Wang, 2025] successfully reduce computational load for structural break detection while maintaining or minimally impacting ROC AUC performance compared to a non-adaptive full analysis?
*   **RQ5 (Interpretability of Breaks):** Can the causal decomposition of differing pre-break (Rule_A) and post-break (Rule_B) ECA rules provide meaningful and interpretable insights into the qualitative nature of the detected structural changes [Riedel & Zenil, 2018]?
