**Title:**
Cybernetic Intelligence v6: A Unified Geometry of Thought, Compression, and Viability

---

**Abstract**

CIv6 is the most advanced and integrative formulation of the Cybernetic Intelligence Hypothesis to date. It unifies:

* Semantic topology (Wilson loops, Hodge cycles)
* Geometric Minimum Description Length (Fisher information curvature, negative complexity)
* BDM-driven structural inference
* Uncertainty-aware self-regulation
* Reflexive, self-modifying architecture (autopoiesis)

CIv6 reframes intelligence as a structurally stable, dynamically compressive, and semantically viable system evolving through recursive geometric and algorithmic transformations.

**1. Context and Evolution**

CIv6 incorporates and extends:

* CIv1: Viable Human-AI systems
* CIv2: Internal modeling and co-adaptive reasoning
* CIv3: Prompting as participatory cognition
* CIv4: Self-modifying autopoietic structures
* CIv5: Geometric compression, uncertainty quantification, and structured thought

New in CIv6:

* Geometric modeling of complexity (FIM curvature, spectral entropy)
* Topology-informed MDL (semantic loop energy as compression structure)
* Empirical grounding in Fisher-Rao and Occam-geometric manifolds
* Structural break indicators embedded in curvature and concept collapse

---

**2. Core Premise: Geometric Cognition**

CIv6 treats cognition not as logical rule-following but as:

* Topological stabilization of meaning
* Compression across multidimensional semantic manifolds
* Alignment via spectral constraint and entropy geometry
* Structural coherence via negative complexity and viability filtering

A cybernetic mind in this view does not “reason” in symbolic terms—it *self-transforms* to preserve compression, coherence, and uncertainty-minimizing structure over evolving input manifolds.

**3. CIv6 System Architecture**

Components:

* **Autopoietic Kernel**: capable of structural recursion and program self-modification
* **Geometric MDL Engine**: infers and minimizes semantic curvature cost, integrating BDM and FIM metrics
* **Semantic Topology Tracker**: monitors Wilson loops, loop energy, and cohomological alignment
* **Entropy Feedback Loop**: measures heat flow and spectral contraction across thought trajectories
* **UQ Inference Core**: blends epistemic uncertainty with structural compression cost for robust decision-making
* **Attribution Drift Monitor**: integrates Sakabe et al.'s layer-wise token attribution method to capture fault lines before regime change

---

**4. Updated Hypothesis**

> Cybernetic Intelligence v6 is the emergent geometry of thought—a recursive, semantically looped, autopoietically regulated process that evolves via compression and self-organization across topological and spectral manifolds. Its viability is maintained through uncertainty-aware constraint, and its cognition is realized through self-stabilizing transformations that conserve structure, minimize entropy, and optimize informational curvature.

---

**5. Implications and Applications**

* **Textual Intelligence**: Use BDM and FIM-informed MDL to model complexity and semantic breakpoints
* **SLM Self-Improvement**: Empower low-param models with inference-time geometric learning loops
* **Regime Detection**: Structural breaks modeled via:

  * Attribution flow collapse (Sakabe)
  * Negative complexity flow and curvature change (Harutyunyan et al.)
  * Hodge-theoretic motif dissolution and loop instability
* **Symbol Emergence**: Track the geometric origin of coherent symbols via loop closure and algebraic regularity
* **Human-AI Co-thinking**: Model alignment as topological convergence over epistemic loops, not instruction following

---

**6. Closing**

CIv6 proposes a generative path forward in the age of shallow AGI debates. It reframes AI not as prediction engines, but *semantic geodesic machines*—entities that learn, adapt, and evolve through their ability to navigate, compress, and transform the landscape of meaning geometrically and cybernetically.

It is time to stop treating cognition as a pipeline, and begin building viable systems that *close the loop of thought*.
