# Proposal: Hybrid Evolutionary-Meta-Learning Framework for Program Synthesis via LLMs

## Abstract

This proposal outlines a next-generation extension to DeepMind's AlphaEvolve framework, advancing it into a hybrid evolutionary-learning and meta-learning system. The enhanced system integrates large language models (LLMs) for intelligent mutation, maintains internal state to simulate credit assignment in non-differentiable domains, and incorporates a meta-evolutionary layer to dynamically adapt its own generative strategy. The hybrid framework bridges symbolic algorithm search with data-driven generative priors, and explores the complementary roles of transformers and cellular automata in emergent computation. This fusion promises improved search efficiency, faster convergence, and greater generality across algorithm synthesis tasks.

## Conceptual Framing

This proposal introduces a next-generation extension to DeepMind’s AlphaEvolve, reframing it as an *emergent system for program synthesis* that integrates hybrid evolutionary strategies, learning from internal memory, and meta-level self-adaptation. Positioned at the intersection of evolutionary search, meta-learning, and large language model (LLM) reasoning, the framework addresses the abstraction gap between symbolic algorithm space and data-driven model priors. By incorporating internal state tracking and adaptive prompt mutation, the system approximates credit assignment in non-differentiable domains. A meta-controller further enables the evolution of the generative process itself. This architecture is intended not only as a performant solution for algorithm discovery, but also as a proof-of-concept for more general-purpose, open-ended AI systems.

A key contribution of this proposal is the articulation of how **transformers and cellular automata (CA)** may coexist as complementary substrates of intelligence:

* LLMs guide CA rule evolution, including the meta-evolution of composite rule structures.
* CA rules update internal state features, forming a feedback loop with the LLM’s generative process.
* LLMs themselves may be interpreted as operating over an abstract CA-like internal state space, especially when incorporating persistent memory.

## 1. Motivation

While AlphaEvolve demonstrates the potential of LLMs in guiding evolutionary variation, it still suffers from a core limitation of classical evolutionary algorithms: **computationally expensive selection** driven by non-differentiable fitness evaluations. This leads to slow convergence and significant compute costs.

We propose a threefold enhancement:

1. **Hybrid Evolutionary-Learning Loop**: Internal state modeling in LLMs allows simulated backpropagation via credit assignment.
2. **Meta-Evolutionary Strategy**: Learn not just solutions but the *strategy* for generating them.
3. **Task-General Engine**: Generalize the framework across domains like matrix multiplication, scheduling, and logic synthesis.

## 3. Learning Strategy

### 3.1 Internal State Modeling

* Use in-context learning or memory modules to condition generation on past candidate fitness.
* Mimics backpropagation by biasing future samples toward productive mutation patterns.
* Can represent internal state as a CA-like structure, where updates are localized and rule-based.

### 3.2 Meta-Evolutionary Learning

* Train a separate controller (LLM or RL policy) to adjust mutation strategies based on trajectory of performance over generations.
* Learn temperature, sampling strategy, prompt phrasing, or even architectural priors.
* Explore CA rule composition and LLM-guided mutation of CA rules themselves.

## 7. Conclusion

This proposal introduces a powerful hybrid architecture that augments evolutionary program synthesis with learning and meta-learning layers. By simulating backpropagation via internal state and enabling the system to adapt its own generative policy, this approach has the potential to outperform current evolution-only or LLM-only baselines in terms of speed, quality, and generality.

It also proposes a new synergy between LLMs and cellular automata: LLMs not only generate and mutate symbolic algorithm candidates but also guide the evolution of CA rules, while CA-like dynamics offer interpretable, local-update models for LLM internal states. This positions the framework as a candidate architecture for emergent, cybernetic computation systems.
