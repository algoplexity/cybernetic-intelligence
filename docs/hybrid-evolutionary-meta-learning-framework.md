# Proposal: Hybrid Evolutionary-Meta-Learning Framework for Program Synthesis via LLMs

## Abstract

This proposal outlines a next-generation extension to DeepMind's AlphaEvolve framework, advancing it into a hybrid evolutionary-learning and meta-learning system. The enhanced system integrates large language models (LLMs) for intelligent mutation, maintains internal state to simulate credit assignment in non-differentiable domains, and incorporates a meta-evolutionary layer to dynamically adapt its own generative strategy. This hybrid framework promises improved search efficiency, faster convergence, and greater generality across algorithm synthesis tasks.

## Conceptual Framing

This proposal introduces a next-generation extension to DeepMindâ€™s AlphaEvolve, reframing it as an *emergent system for program synthesis* that integrates hybrid evolutionary strategies, learning from internal memory, and meta-level self-adaptation. Positioned at the intersection of evolutionary search, meta-learning, and large language model (LLM) reasoning, the framework addresses the abstraction gap between symbolic algorithm space and data-driven model priors. By incorporating internal state tracking and adaptive prompt mutation, the system approximates credit assignment in non-differentiable domains. A meta-controller further enables the evolution of the generative process itself. This architecture is intended not only as a performant solution for algorithm discovery, but also as a proof-of-concept for more general-purpose, open-ended AI systems.

## 1. Motivation

While AlphaEvolve demonstrates the potential of LLMs in guiding evolutionary variation, it still suffers from a core limitation of classical evolutionary algorithms: **computationally expensive selection** driven by non-differentiable fitness evaluations. This leads to slow convergence and significant compute costs.

We propose a threefold enhancement:

1. **Hybrid Evolutionary-Learning Loop**: Internal state modeling in LLMs allows simulated backpropagation via credit assignment.
2. **Meta-Evolutionary Strategy**: Learn not just solutions but the *strategy* for generating them.
3. **Task-General Engine**: Generalize the framework across domains like matrix multiplication, scheduling, and logic synthesis.

### 3.1 Internal State Modeling

* Use in-context learning or memory modules to condition generation on past candidate fitness.
* Mimics backpropagation by biasing future samples toward productive mutation patterns.

### 3.2 Meta-Evolutionary Learning

* Train a separate controller (LLM or RL policy) to adjust mutation strategies based on trajectory of performance over generations.
* Learn temperature, sampling strategy, prompt phrasing, or even architectural priors.
