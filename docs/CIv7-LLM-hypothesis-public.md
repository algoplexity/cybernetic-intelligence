**Title:** CIv7-LLM Hypothesis (Public Version)

---

**Abstract**

The CIv7-LLM Hypothesis proposes a geometric and compression-based theory of language model cognition. This version presents the public-facing articulation, focusing on the core scientific ideas without disclosing implementation-level architectural detail. We frame transformer-based large language models (LLMs) as cybernetic systems that compress latent geometry and exhibit structural failure under complexity transitions.

**1. Hypothesis Statement**

> Transformers reason through the compression and transformation of latent semantic geometry. Structural breakdowns in performance correspond to geometric instability, attribution drift, or compression failure in these latent manifolds.

---

**2. Core Scientific Motivation**

* LLMs do not simply predict tokens — they encode meaning as **compressed manifolds** in activation space.
* Reasoning failures (e.g., hallucination, off-by-one logic errors, loss of coherence) correspond to disruptions in this compression.
* Concepts in LLMs emerge through a form of **semantic attractor geometry** — stabilized through training and reused during inference.
* Geometry-based features such as **attention cycles, curvature flow, and alignment torsion** help quantify coherence.

---

**3. Compositional Mechanisms**

* **Transformer Attention Layers** form a geometric scaffold — approximated by loop energy and torsion-like feedback across attention heads.
* **MLP Layers** extract invariant features from compressed activations — algebraic distillation analogous to basis transformation.
* **Breakpoints** emerge when latent topologies collapse — semantic loops break, manifolds fold, or attribution paths diverge.

---

**4. Failure as Signal**

* Instead of avoiding LLM failures, CIv7-LLM treats them as indicators of epistemic boundaries.
* Breakdowns in alignment (e.g., steering vector failure) signal underlying topological distortion.
* Compression inefficiency (e.g., perplexity spikes, misalignment of token paths) reflects regime change.

---

**5. Measurement and Detection**

* **Semantic Loop Energy**: Detect dissipation or collapse of closed attention circuits.
* **Fisher Information Curvature**: Track rank and spectral shifts of Jacobian/Hessian structures.
* **Attribution Drift**: Use token-level tracing to monitor concept trajectory bifurcations.
* **Compression Signal Drop**: Negative log-likelihood and loss surface curvature reveal concept collapse.

---

**6. Framing for Synthetic Data and Evaluation**

* CIv7-LLM enables **model diagnostics** under uncertainty — showing when, where, and why the model’s internal representation fails.
* Instead of training for accuracy alone, train for **compressive robustness** and resilience under transformation.
* Synthetic data generation under CIv7 uses **targeted perturbation** to locate compressive instability boundaries.

---

**7. Use Cases and Strategic Impact**

* **Structural Break Detection**: Detect where model fails to compress future given past.
* **Synthetic Data Evaluation**: Probes model generalization and robustness across complexity jumps.
* **Trustworthy AI**: Align failure signals with causal geometry for transparent, auditable reasoning.
