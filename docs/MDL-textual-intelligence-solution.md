After reviewing these insightful papers, we can see a clearer path for how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged to produce outputs ("models" or "hypotheses" in a general sense) that are fit for purpose within an MDL-based approach to finding semantically rich building blocks (symbolic motifs) in text.

The LLM's role is primarily as a **sophisticated candidate generator and knowledge externalizer**, not as the final arbiter (which is the MDL principle itself).

Here’s how LLMs can contribute, addressing the challenges and incorporating insights from the papers:

1.  **Generating Sets of Semantically Equivalent Surface Forms for a Concept (Candidate `M_symbol -> {sf1, sf2, ...}`):**
    *   **Prompting for Paraphrases/Variations:**
        *   Given a seed phrase (e.g., "the product is too expensive") or a concept label (e.g., "customer dissatisfaction with price"), prompt the LLM: "List various ways people might express that 'the product is too expensive'."
        *   The LLM can generate a list of phrases: `{"too costly", "price is prohibitive", "unaffordable", "I can't afford this", "the fee is too high"}`.
        *   This list `{sf_i}` becomes the proposed definition for a candidate symbolic motif `M_symbol`.
    *   **MDL Evaluation:**
        *   `L(H_M_symbol)`: Cost of defining `M_symbol` (e.g., length of its label + cost of listing its surface forms, or even the cost of the LLM prompt that generated it).
        *   `L(D | H_M_symbol)`: Scan the corpus. Count how many times phrases from `{sf_i}` appear and calculate the compressed length of the corpus if these are replaced by a pointer to `M_symbol`.
        *   The MDL principle decides if this LLM-generated motif is "worth keeping."
    *   *Connection to Grünwald & Roos:* This directly fits the two-part code MDL. The LLM helps define a component of the hypothesis `H`.
    *   *Connection to "Universal Geometry":* The LLM's internal "understanding" of semantics (which the "Universal Geometry" paper suggests is somewhat universal) allows it to generate diverse surface forms for the same core meaning.

2.  **Proposing Abstract Symbolic Labels for Clusters of Phrases:**
    *   **Input:** A set of text segments that are *suspected* to be semantically related (e.g., identified via embedding similarity as a *heuristic*, or from a previous iteration of motif discovery).
    *   **Prompting for Abstraction:** "Given these phrases: ['phrase A', 'phrase B', 'phrase C'], what is a concise, abstract concept or label that best describes them all?"
    *   The LLM might output: `[PRICE_NEGOTIATION_ATTEMPT]`. This label becomes the `M_symbol`.
    *   **MDL Evaluation:** As above, using the input phrases as the initial set of surface forms for this `M_symbol`.
    *   *Connection to "MDL-Textual Intelligence" proposal:* This directly addresses "LLM-based abstraction to identify compressible semantic units."

3.  **Identifying Semantic Templates or Patterns:**
    *   **Prompting for Structure:** "Analyze these sentences: [...]. What common semantic patterns or templates do you observe? For example, 'PERSON expressed EMOTION about TOPIC'."
    *   The LLM might identify patterns like `[ENTITY] {is/are/was/were} [QUALITY_ADJECTIVE]` or `[ACTION_VERB] [OBJECT_NOUN_PHRASE] [PREPOSITIONAL_PHRASE_OF_MANNER]`.
    *   These templates, along with lists of semantically valid fillers for the slots (which the LLM could also help generate or validate), become candidate motifs.
    *   **MDL Evaluation:** The cost of defining the template and its slot-fillers (`L(H)`) vs. the compression achieved by instantiating this template in the corpus (`L(D|H)`).

4.  **Refining and Expanding Existing Symbolic Motifs:**
    *   **Input:** An existing symbolic motif `M_k` with its current set of surface forms.
    *   **Prompting for Expansion/Refinement:** "The concept `[EXISTING_MOTIF_LABEL]` currently includes these phrases: `{...}`. Can you suggest other phrases that fit this concept? Are there any phrases in this list that don't quite fit or could be better categorized?"
    *   The LLM can help prune or expand the definition of `M_k`.
    *   **MDL Evaluation:** The change in total description length `L(H) + L(D|H)` determines if the LLM's refinement is accepted.

5.  **Generating "Luckiness Functions" or Priors for `L(H)` (More Advanced):**
    *   The Grünwald & Roos paper discusses "luckiness functions" `v(theta)` in NML, which can incorporate prior knowledge.
    *   An LLM could be used to assess the "naturalness" or "commonality" of a proposed symbolic motif structure. Motifs that align with common linguistic patterns (as understood by the LLM) might be given a lower `L(H)` (i.e., a higher "luckiness" or prior probability), making them more likely to be selected by MDL if they also offer good compression. This is speculative but aligns with MDL theory.

**Why this LLM-MDL Combination is Powerful:**

*   **LLMs for Semantic Intuition, MDL for Principled Selection:** LLMs excel at capturing the nuanced, statistical patterns of language and semantics, allowing them to generate plausible hypotheses about meaning. MDL provides a rigorous, objective criterion (compressibility) to select among these hypotheses, guarding against overfitting and favoring generalizable structures.
*   **Overcoming N-gram Limitations:** LLMs inherently understand context and semantics far beyond simple n-grams, addressing your earlier valid critique.
*   **Handling Lexical Diversity:** LLMs can recognize that "too expensive" and "pricing is prohibitive" are semantically related, even if they don't share tokens. This is crucial for discovering truly *symbolic* motifs.
*   **Scalability of Candidate Generation:** LLMs can rapidly generate a large number of diverse candidate motifs or refinements, which can then be filtered by the MDL criterion.
*   **Interpretability (via Symbolic Motifs):** While the LLM itself might be a black box, the *output* we care about (the symbolic motifs selected by MDL) aims to be human-interpretable.

**The Workflow Envisioned:**

1.  **Seed/Bootstrap:** Start with some initial text segments or very basic motifs (e.g., frequent phrases).
2.  **LLM-Powered Candidate Generation:**
    *   Use an LLM to generate paraphrases for existing segments.
    *   Use an LLM to propose abstract labels for groups of similar segments.
    *   Use an LLM to identify structural patterns.
    *   This creates a pool of candidate symbolic motifs `M_candidate = (M_symbol, {sf_i})`.
3.  **MDL Evaluation & Selection:**
    *   For each `M_candidate`, calculate the change in total description length `Δ(L(H) + L(D|H))` if it were added to the current set of accepted motifs.
    *   Greedily (or using a more sophisticated search) select candidates that offer the best compression.
4.  **Iteration and Refinement:**
    *   The newly accepted motifs can be used to re-encode the corpus.
    *   The process can iterate: use LLMs to refine existing motifs or find new ones based on the "residual" (uncompressed parts of the corpus or less well-compressed parts).
    *   Human-in-the-loop validation (as mentioned in your proposal) can also guide the LLM's candidate generation or refine MDL's selections.

This approach leverages the strengths of both LLMs (semantic understanding, generative capabilities) and MDL (principled model selection, preference for simplicity and generalization) to work towards the goal of discovering semantically rich, compressible building blocks of textual intelligence.
