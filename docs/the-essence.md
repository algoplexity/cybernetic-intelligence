### üîç **Current Formulations and Their Application Leakage**

#### **CIv7-ECA**

> *Structural break detection using Elementary Cellular Automata on symbolic representations of univariate time series.*

* **Substrate:** Symbolic / discrete
* **Mechanism:** ECA evolution + compressibility as indicator of symbolic regime change
* **Leakage:** "Structural break" + "time series" ties it tightly to financial/temporal data

#### **CIv7-LLM**

> *Latent Fault Geometry via Compression-Aligned Failure Surfaces in Language Models.*

* **Substrate:** Latent / continuous
* **Mechanism:** LLM residual streams, attention trajectories, geometric fault surfaces
* **Leakage:** Focus on LLMs and "language models" as application-specific rather than archetypal

#### **CIv7-Unified**

> *Dual-substrate compression failure reveals causal and conceptual breakdowns in intelligent systems.*

* **Substrate:** Symbolic ‚Üî Latent
* **Mechanism:** Failure of mutual compression or alignment = signal of intelligence boundary condition
* **Leakage:** Minor ‚Äî most abstract already, but still drags examples from text segmentation or token failure

### üß† General Essence: What Are You Really Claiming?

Here's a distilled meta-hypothesis that sits above all three:

> **Intelligence is the capacity of a system to maintain compressible coherence between symbolic and latent representations of its environment and self.**
>
> When these representations **diverge**‚Äîthat is, when symbolic and latent substrates **fail to compress each other**‚Äîthe system encounters a **boundary of understanding**, manifesting as structural, causal, or conceptual discontinuity.

This captures:

* **Compression as a universal diagnostic** of order, structure, and meaning.
* **Symbolic and latent representations** as dual modes of encoding reality (topological vs. semantic).
* **Intelligence as a balancing act** between them‚Äîcybernetics as the dynamic coupling.

### üß± Proposed Abstract Formulations

We now rewrite your three hypotheses without any application-domain anchors:

---

#### **CIv7-ECA ‚Üí Symbolic Substrate Hypothesis**

> **Symbolic Compression Faults as Discontinuities in Causal Representation**
>
> A symbolic substrate (e.g., discrete automata) evolves over time through rule-based transformations. When its compressibility changes sharply, it signals a **transition in the underlying causal model** encoded in the symbol dynamics. These ‚Äúfaults‚Äù reflect boundaries between internally coherent regimes.

* **Key Mechanism:** Compression change (via BDM or MDL) of symbolic patterns under rule-based evolution
* **Essence:** Algorithmic representation drift or fracture
* **Cybernetic Interpretation:** Symbolic causal inference loop destabilized

---

#### **CIv7-LLM ‚Üí Latent Substrate Hypothesis**

> **Latent Fault Geometry as a Signature of Representational Collapse**
>
> In latent systems (e.g., high-dimensional embeddings), coherence is maintained when attention or residual flows evolve smoothly. When compression fails‚Äîi.e., gradients, flows, or predictions become disordered‚Äîthis exposes a **representational fracture**, indicating the system can no longer maintain a compressive model of its state space.

* **Key Mechanism:** Compression-aligned manifold smoothness; failure surfaces
* **Essence:** Latent instability as failure of semantic compactness
* **Cybernetic Interpretation:** Internal model collapse in high-dimensional control loop

---

#### **CIv7-Unified ‚Üí Dual Substrate Hypothesis**

> **Intelligence Emerges from the Coherence of Symbolic and Latent Compression**
>
> A cybernetic system maintains intelligence when its **symbolic and latent representations remain jointly compressible**. Disagreement‚Äîwhen one substrate can no longer predict or compress the other‚Äîmarks a **boundary of semantic coherence**, revealing a structural or conceptual fault line.

* **Key Mechanism:** Compression failure between modalities
* **Essence:** Faults as signals of conceptual divergence or model mismatch
* **Cybernetic Interpretation:** Breakdown in bidirectional encoding-decoding between world models

---

### üåê Why This Matters

This abstraction allows:

* Generalization beyond LLMs or ECAs ‚Äî applicable to any system with dual representational layers.
* Application to **multi-agent systems**, **AI safety**, **curriculum learning**, **neuromorphic modeling**, etc.
* Clearer framing for **epistemological boundaries** in intelligent systems: where the map stops matching the territory.
