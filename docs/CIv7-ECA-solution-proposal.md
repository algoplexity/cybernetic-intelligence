# **CIv7-ECA: Solution Proposal**

## **Symbolic Substrate Diagnostics for Structural Break Detection**

### **1. Objective**

To implement an end-to-end system that applies the CIv7-ECA hypothesis to:

* Detect structural breaks in univariate time series (e.g., stock prices)
* Interpret them as *algorithmic discontinuities*, *topological bifurcations*, or *semantic collapses*
* Provide early warnings of instability and generate predictive fault geometries
* Serve as a causal mirror for parallel interpretability in text-based systems (e.g., financial news)

---

### **2. System Architecture**

#### **2.1 Input Encoding Pipeline**

* **Raw Input**: Univariate time series (e.g., daily closing prices)
* **Symbolisation Layer**:

  * Apply multiple encodings: Delta Sign Encoding, Permutation Patterns, Quantised Returns
  * Output: symbolic sequences (e.g., 'U', 'D', 'F') with tunable resolution

#### **2.2 Substrate Evolution Engine**

* **Cellular Automata Layer**:

  * Apply Class IV Elementary Cellular Automata (e.g., Rule 110, Rule 54) over sliding windows
  * Encode symbol streams as 2D evolution diagrams
  * Apply *motif tracking* across generations

#### **2.3 Multimodal Fault Detection**

Evaluate the evolved substrate using:

* **Algorithmic Compression Layer**:

  * Compute BDM or CTM complexity over the 2D substrate
  * Track derivative shifts, motif entropy, and compressibility gradients

* **Topological Invariant Layer**:

  * Track motif torsion, bifurcations, and attractor collapse
  * Use persistent homology (via topological data analysis) to identify phase transition candidates

* **MDL-Based Divergence Tracker**:

  * Implement predictive coding using universal NML codes (Grünwald)
  * Compute divergence between actual vs. encoded sequences to detect statistical instability

* **Motif Fault Geometry Extractor**:

  * Apply motif clustering and construct symbolic fault manifolds
  * Annotate symbolic transitions where circuit rewiring or attractor collapse occurs

### **3. Discontinuity Classification & Explanation Module**

#### **3.1 Fault Typology Classifier**

* Map transitions to the discontinuity types outlined in the hypothesis:

  * Compression collapse
  * Topological bifurcation
  * Motif entropy jump
  * Steering analogue failure (symbolic motifs fail to generalise)
  * Edge-of-chaos degeneracy

#### **3.2 Causal Annotation Engine**

* Generate interpretable summaries (e.g., “breakpoint due to collapse in motif class entropy at t=167”)
* Trace fault geometry paths over time as semi-symbolic narratives

#### **3.3 Cross-Modality Bridge**

* Accept external latent encodings from CIv7-LLM textual systems
* Identify isomorphic failure surfaces (e.g., text theme drift aligns with price structure break)

---

### **4. Prediction & Early Warning**

#### **4.1 Causal Attractor Projection**

* Use current ECA motif evolution to project likely attractor zones
* Estimate risk of transition to new causal regime

#### **4.2 Generative Scenario Simulation**

* Generate plausible post-break symbolic evolutions under varying CA rule sets
* Identify candidate causes via symbolic ablation

---

### **5. Integration and Interfaces**

* **Output Dashboards**:

  * Breakpoint timelines, motif maps, torsion heatmaps
* **APIs**:

  * For passing symbolic encodings to CIv7-LLM systems
  * For retrieving semantic correlates from financial news themes

---

### **6. Benefits**

* **Model-Agnostic**: Works as an interpretability shell around black-box models
* **Symbolic Transparency**: Provides traceable fault paths instead of opaque anomaly flags
* **Causal Compression Diagnostics**: Not only detects breaks but infers *why* compressibility failed
* **Cross-Substrate Harmony**: Can inform LLMs of breaks, and vice versa
