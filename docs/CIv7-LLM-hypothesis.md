## **CIv7-LLM: Latent Fault Geometry via Compression-Aligned Failure Surfaces in Language Models**

### **General Hypothesis**

Structural failures in language model behavior—such as hallucination, steering unreliability, generalisation collapse, and semantic drift—can be robustly detected and interpreted by analyzing **latent representations** (residual stream activations, attention flows, feedforward layer outputs) as a **compressive and topological substrate**.

This latent substrate exhibits **discontinuities** that serve as failure surfaces, exposing breakdowns in causal coherence, conceptual fidelity, and semantic topology. These transitions are algorithmic, geometric, and information-theoretic in nature, and correspond to failures in:

* **Joint compression** across unsupervised embeddings and supervised task representations (Sutskever)
* **Latent coherence collapse** under perturbations in input, prompting, or fine-tuning strategies
* **Steering vector unreliability** due to inconsistency in activation geometry (Braun et al.)
* **Semantic underfitting** due to over-compression (Shani et al.)
* **Attractor basin instability** in residual stream trajectories under multi-task training (SASR)
* **Loss of torsion and cohomology** in attention-induced manifold flows (Walch, Hodge, Langlands)
* **Vector field bifurcations** in attention heads during role-switching or instruction generalisation
* **Failure of harmonic alignment** between context frames and internal latent circuits (Anthropic, OpenAI)
* **Embedding inversion leakage** under cross-model projection (vec2vec, Jha et al.)
* **Topological misalignment in graph-augmented inputs** (GFSE, Chen et al.)

These discontinuities manifest in both **quantitative** terms (e.g., loss of steering reliability, drop in KL-coherence, activation variance spikes) and **geometric/algorithmic** terms (e.g., manifold folding, torsion loss, compression asymmetry).

### **Distinguished Application: Textual Thematic Intelligence**

In the context of **thematic analysis of large text corpora**, CIv7-LLM hypothesizes that latent fault geometry can explain and resolve common failures in:

* **Topic drift** in long-context summarization
* **Loss of conceptual granularity** in supervised fine-tuning
* **Inconsistency in thematic labelling across clusters**
* **Collapse of representative motifs** under prompt-based reasoning
* **Semantic incoherence in contrastive summarization or multi-perspective generation**

By analyzing latent circuit evolution during thematic decomposition, we detect when the model fails to preserve:

* **Representational continuity** across similar inputs
* **Compression fidelity** when summarizing multi-theme documents
* **Causal semantic consistency** across subquestions (e.g., QID-level analysis)

Such analysis can inform corrective strategies like:

* Injecting **latent steering gradients** for motif alignment
* Using **MDL-based motif discovery** to detect high-likelihood fault transitions
* Leveraging **joint compression insights** between `X = corpus` and `Y = theme summary` to extract mutual structure (Sutskever’s principle)

### **Discontinuities as Hallmarks of Meaning-Making Failure**

The following are observed as robust indicators of latent structural failure in LLM reasoning:

1. **Steering vector unreliability**: Failure to consistently adjust output distribution in target directions.
2. **Joint compression failure**: Sudden divergence between latent summaries and their originating corpus segments.
3. **Directional disagreement in latent space**: Mismatch between motif activation vectors across prompt formats.
4. **Semantic attractor collapse**: When multiple plausible latent interpretations are collapsed into a degenerate summary.
5. **Circuit rewiring**: Reversal or dissociation of attention roles in long-sequence contexts (Circuit Tracer analog).
6. **Reality signal confusion**: Inability to distinguish hallucinated summaries from factual attribution (Dijkstra et al.).
7. **Gradient-collapse under fine-tuning**: Over-specialization of latent channels in RLHF training loops.
8. **Bifurcation in activation space**: Emergence of incompatible vector fields for the same motif under prompt shifts.
9. **Latent leakage paths**: Information encoded in non-salient neurons becomes invertible across unrelated prompts (Jha et al.).
10. **Conceptual compression distortion**: Loss of thematic diversity due to excessive KL minimization (Shani et al.).

### **Rationale and Theoretical Underpinning**

* **Sutskever's compression-as-prediction** model supports the notion that shared structure between unsupervised text (`X`) and task-target (`Y`) creates meaningful joint compressors. Failures emerge when this structure is misaligned.
* **Braun et al.** show how steering success depends on the latent separability and directionality of activation vectors—making these directly measurable failure surfaces in latent space.
* **Shani et al.** demonstrate how human-aligned concept structures are more semantically diffuse, while LLMs over-compress, trading nuance for regularity.
* **Walch and Hodge** draw from algebraic topology to explain that geometric invariants (e.g., torsion, harmonic forms) stabilize meaning—but fail under latent folding, as seen during curriculum overfit or instruction collapse.
* **SASR and AlphaEvolve** reinforce that training stage transitions are non-linear transformations of latent geometry, often creating irreversible distortions.
* **Jha et al.** and **vec2vec** reveal how universal alignment across embedding spaces can be exploited to detect or project failure modes across models—informing fault diagnosis and repair.
