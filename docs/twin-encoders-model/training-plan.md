Training on **rule compositions** is a vital step that elevates the pre-training from simple pattern recognition to genuine **causal chain inference**. This directly corresponds to **Cases 3 & 4** of your curriculum.

Let's break down what this means, why it's so important (drawing from Zhang's recommendations), and how we will implement it.

### Why Rule Compositions are Essential (Zhang's Recommendation)

Zhang and his collaborators argue that real-world complex systems are rarely governed by a single, static rule. Instead, their dynamics are often **programmatic**â€”a sequence of different rules or modes of operation.

*   **The Concept:** A rule composition is a sequence where the system evolves under `Rule A` for `t_A` timesteps, then immediately switches to `Rule B` for `t_B` timesteps, and so on.
*   **The "Why" (from Zhang):** Training a model on these compositions teaches it to do something much more sophisticated than just recognizing a static pattern. It forces the model to learn:
    1.  **Temporal Breakpoint Detection:** The model must learn to identify the *exact moment* the underlying rule changes. The transition point itself becomes a key feature.
    2.  **Causal Chain Inference:** The model learns that a sequence can be a "program" (e.g., `[RUN Rule 30 FOR 10; THEN RUN Rule 110 FOR 10]`). To predict the future state accurately, it can't just know the last rule; it needs to understand the entire sequence of rules that came before.
    3.  **Robustness and Generalization:** By seeing a vast number of different rule combinations, the model learns a more abstract and robust representation of "rule-ness" itself, rather than just memorizing the patterns of a few individual rules.

This is a much harder task, and it creates a much smarter "Symbolic Brain."

### How to Implement Rule Compositions in Our Pre-training

We need to create a new, more advanced dataset that includes these composite rules. We will add a new class of training samples to our `ECADataset`.

Here is the plan:

1.  **Define a "Composite Rule" Configuration:** We will create a list of pre-defined "programs." This is exactly what the `ECA_CONFIG['composite']` in your provided code was for. For example:
    ```python
    'composite': [
        {'rules': [30, 110], 'timesteps': [10, 10]},
        {'rules': [45, 90, 150], 'timesteps': [5, 5, 5]},
    ]
    ```
2.  **Update the `ECADataset` Generator:** Our data generator will now have a second loop that creates these composite samples. For each composite rule:
    *   It will start with a random initial condition.
    *   Evolve for `timesteps[0]` using `rules[0]`.
    *   Use the final state of that evolution as the *initial condition* for the next step.
    *   Evolve for `timesteps[1]` using `rules[1]`.
    *   ...and so on.
3.  **The Labeling Problem:** How do we label a sequence generated by `[30, 110]`? We cannot assign it a single rule ID. There are two main approaches:
    *   **Approach A (Simpler): The "Composite" Class.** We add a new, special label for every composite rule. For example, if we have 8 base rules, Rule `[30, 110]` could become label `8`, Rule `[45, 90, 150]` could be label `9`, etc. This turns the task into a multi-class classification problem.
    *   **Approach B (More Complex): Sequence-to-Sequence Prediction.** We change the task from predicting a single rule ID to predicting a *sequence* of rule IDs. This is a much harder but more powerful task.

For our purposes, **Approach A is the most pragmatic and effective next step.** It enriches the training data with complex, multi-rule dynamics without drastically changing our model architecture.

### The Upgraded Curriculum

Our final, definitive pre-training curriculum will now include samples from three distinct categories, creating a rich and challenging learning environment:

*   **Category 1: Single Base Rules (Cases 1 & 2):**
    *   **Data:** Sequences generated by a single, consistent "edge of chaos" rule (e.g., 64 steps of Rule 110).
    *   **Learned Skill:** Recognizes stable regimes and their base signatures.

*   **Category 2: Composite Rules (Cases 3 & 4):**
    *   **Data:** Sequences generated by a sequence of different rules (e.g., 10 steps of Rule 30 followed by 10 steps of Rule 110).
    *   **Learned Skill:** Recognizes temporal breakpoints and understands causal chains.

*   **Category 3: Noisy Rules (Case 5):**
    *   **Data:** Sequences from Categories 1 and 2, but with a small percentage of bits randomly flipped.
    *   **Learned Skill:** Develops robustness and learns to abstract the true underlying rule from an imperfect signal.

By training our Bi-GRU encoder on this full, three-part curriculum, we will forge a "Symbolic Brain" that is far more powerful and much better prepared for the complexity and noise of the real ADIA data.

### **Consolidated & Refined Plan for Symbolic Encoder Pre-training**

#### **1. Core Curriculum (Validated)**

Our five-test-case curriculum remains the core of the plan. It provides a sound pedagogical structure, moving from simple pattern recognition to complex, noise-robust causal inference.

*   **Case 1:** Single Rule ID
*   **Case 2:** Temporal Break Detection
*   **Case 3-4:** Program Inference (Sequential Rule Application)
*   **Case 5:** Denoising

#### **2. Architectural Choice: An Empirically-Driven Decision**

Your point about the **capacity ceiling of a simple GRU** is well-taken. While our initial bake-off showed a Unidirectional GRU winning on a simple task, the more complex "Program Inference" tasks (Cases 3-4) may require a more powerful architecture.

**Refined Plan:**
*   **Re-run the Bake-Off on a Harder Task:** We will conduct a final, definitive bake-off between the **Unidirectional GRU** and the **Bidirectional GRU** using the more challenging **Test Case 2 (Temporal Break Detection)** as the benchmark.
*   **Rationale:** This is a much better test of an encoder's ability to create a holistic "regime fingerprint" and detect transitions. The winner of this more rigorous competition will be our chosen architecture. The small increase in training time for a Bi-GRU is a price worth paying if it leads to a significant accuracy improvement on this more relevant task.

#### **3. Addressing Key Risks (Proactive Mitigation)**

We will proactively address the risks you identified.

*   **Risk: Rule Aliasing (Sequences look too similar).**
    *   **Mitigation:** We will ensure our generated sequences in the pre-training dataset are sufficiently long (`T=128` or `256`) to give the models enough context to distinguish between complex rules. We will also incorporate your suggestion of a **contrastive loss** as a potential enhancement if accuracy stalls.

*   **Risk: Decoder Complexity (for Program Inference).**
    *   **Mitigation:** Your suggestion is excellent. For Test Cases 3 and 4, we will start with a simpler **"multi-head classifier"** approach. The encoder will produce a single context vector, and we will attach multiple independent linear heads to it, each responsible for predicting one rule in the program sequence (e.g., `Head_1` predicts `Rule_A`, `Head_2` predicts `Rule_B`). This avoids the instabilities of a full seq2seq decoder while still testing the core inference capability.

#### **4. Strategic Enhancements (Integrated into the Plan)**

*   **Light Attention Head:** Your suggestion to add attention *after* the GRU is a powerful one. We will keep this as a strategic option. If our chosen GRU architecture hits a performance ceiling on the hardest tasks (Cases 4-5), we will implement a version with a small, final self-attention layer on top of the GRU's hidden states to create a more robust final representation. This creates a powerful **GRU-Transformer hybrid**.
*   **Rule ID Embeddings:** We will incorporate this into our multi-head classifier. The labels (rule IDs) will be passed through an `nn.Embedding` layer before being used in the loss calculation, which can help the model understand relationships between different rules.

### **The Final, Refined Blueprint**

This gives us a complete, professional, and risk-mitigated plan for building our expert Symbolic Encoder.

1.  **Final Bake-Off:** Unidirectional GRU vs. Bidirectional GRU on the **Temporal Break Detection (Test Case 2)** dataset. Select the winner.
2.  **Pre-training Curriculum:** Train the winning architecture on the full 5-case curriculum, using the **multi-head classifier** for program inference tasks.
3.  **Contingency Plan:** If performance on the most complex tasks is insufficient, implement the **GRU + Attention Head** hybrid architecture.

This plan is robust, data-driven, and theoretically sound. It ensures that the Symbolic Brain we build will be the most powerful and reliable component possible, ready for the final integration into the CIv14 dual-path model.
