## **C4 Solution Architecture: CIv14 Cybernetic Divergence Detector**

### **1. Introduction & Executive Summary**

This document outlines the software architecture for the **CIv14 Cybernetic Divergence Detector**, a system designed to identify structural breaks in multivariate time series data. The system is predicated on the **CIv13/14 hypothesis**, which posits that a structural break is best detected as a **misalignment between the causal surface grammar (symbolic dynamics) and the latent temporal structure (continuous dynamics)** of a system.

The architecture employs a dual-path, neuro-symbolic Siamese network. It is pre-trained on idealized, rule-based systems (Elementary Cellular Automata) and contrastive temporal data (TS2Vec methodology) to create expert encoders. The final model is then fine-tuned to classify the divergence between these two pathways on real-world data. This document follows the C4 model to describe the system at the Context, Container, and Component levels.

**Description:**
The **CIv14 Break Detector** is the system we are building. It is operated by a **Data Scientist** who provides it with raw time series data from a **Market Data Feed**. The system is trained and runs within a **Cloud Compute Environment**, leveraging the **Python ML Ecosystem**. Its final output is a stream of break probabilities, which are consumed by a **Monitoring Dashboard or Alerting System**.

### **Level 2: Containers**

```

**Containers:**

1.  **Feature Engineering Pipeline:** A standalone process responsible for the computationally expensive task of converting the raw ADIA data into symbolic and latent features. It reads from the source and writes to a cache to accelerate subsequent training runs. This was a key lesson from our performance bottlenecks.
2.  **Feature Cache:** A storage system (e.g., a collection of Feather or Parquet files) holding the pre-processed symbolic sequences and raw segments, ready for training.
3.  **Training Service:** The core Python application where the model is trained. It reads from the `Feature Cache`, orchestrates the pre-training and fine-tuning of the dual-path model, and saves the final trained model to the `Model Artifact Store`.
4.  **Model Artifact Store:** A persistent file storage (like Google Drive or an S3 bucket) that holds the serialized, trained model weights (e.g., `best_adia_model.pth`).
5.  **Inference API:** A lightweight web service that loads the trained model from the store and exposes an endpoint to score new pairs of time series segments for break probability.

### **Level 3: Components**

This diagram zooms into the **Training Service** container to show its internal modules. This is where our core logic and intellectual property reside.

    end

    style B fill:#17a2b8,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
```

**Components:**

1.  **Symbolizer (`PermutationSymbolizer`):** A component responsible for converting raw time series data into symbolic sequences using the Bandt-Pompe method with our empirically validated parameters (`d=6, τ=10`).
2.  **ADIADataset:** The PyTorch `Dataset` that interfaces with the `Feature Cache`. It uses the `Symbolizer` and is responsible for serving the four required tensors (`raw_A`, `symbolic_A`, `raw_B`, `symbolic_B`) and the label for each training sample.
3.  **Symbolic Encoder:** A pre-trained Transformer model (the "Symbolic Brain") that has learned to create embeddings representing the "causal grammar" of a symbolic sequence. A **pre-trained Bi-directional GRU**. This model is the "Symbolic Brain," an expert in inferring the underlying "causal grammar" of a symbolic sequence, pre-trained on complex Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA).
4.  **Latent Encoder:** A pre-trained `TSEncoder`  that has learned via contrastive methods to create "fingerprint" embeddings of a raw time series segment's dynamics. A **pre-trained `TSEncoder`** (the "Latent Brain")(from the TS2Vec framework). This model is the "Latent Brain," an expert in creating a "fingerprint" embedding of a raw time series segment's continuous dynamics.
5.  **CIv14 Divergence Classifier:** The central `nn.Module`. It is a Siamese network that contains the two shared encoders. Its primary responsibility is to compute the divergence between the symbolic and latent pathways and feed the combined signal to a final classifier head.
6.  **Training Loop:** The top-level orchestrator that manages epochs, the optimizer, the weighted loss function, and the calculation of the validation AUC score.

### **4. Key Architectural Decisions & Rationale**

This section documents the critical decisions made during development, grounded in our iterative testing.

| Decision | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Adopt a Dual-Path (Neuro-Symbolic) Architecture** | **Empirical Failure of Single Paths:** Standalone tests of both the Latent-Only path (raw data) and the Symbolic-Only path resulted in an AUC score of ~0.5. This proved that neither signal is sufficient on its own and validated the core CIv13/14 hypothesis that the break signal lies in their combined divergence. |
| **2. Use a Siamese (Twin-Encoder) Structure** | **Correct Inductive Bias:** The problem is fundamentally one of *comparison*. A Siamese network, with its shared weights, is architecturally designed to learn a meaningful embedding space for measuring the distance/divergence between two inputs, directly matching the problem statement. |
| **3. Pre-train Encoders on Specialized Tasks** | **Need for Expert Priors:** Training on the noisy ADIA data from scratch failed (AUC ≈ 0.5). To succeed, the encoders need a strong inductive bias. The Symbolic Encoder is pre-trained on ECAs to learn "causality," while the Latent Encoder is pre-trained via contrastive learning to understand "dynamics." |
| **4. Empirically Tune Symbolizer Parameters** | **Data-Driven Configuration:** The Phase 0 Test Harness revealed that `d=6, τ=10` were the most sensitive parameters for detecting symbolic divergence in the actual ADIA data. This grounds our feature engineering in evidence, not guesswork. |
| **5. Use a Weighted Loss Function** | **Handle Class Imbalance:** EDA showed a 71/29 class imbalance. A weighted `BCEWithLogitsLoss` is necessary to prevent the model from becoming biased towards the majority "no-break" class and to ensure it learns to correctly identify the rare "break" events. |
| **6. Implement a Feature Cache** | **Performance Optimization:** Initial tests showed that on-the-fly data processing was a severe bottleneck, with I/O from Google Drive dominating runtime. A pre-compiled cache of processed features is essential for efficient training and iteration. |
| **1. Adopt a Dual-Path (Neuro-Symbolic) Architecture** | **Validated by Empirical Failure of Single Paths:** Standalone tests of both the Latent-Only path (raw data) and the Symbolic-Only path resulted in an AUC score of ~0.5. This proved that neither signal is sufficient on its own and validated the core hypothesis that the break signal lies in their **combined divergence**. |
| **2. Use a Pre-training Strategy for Encoders** | **Grounded in Burtsev & Zhang's Work:** Research shows that Transformers/RNNs can infer the causal rules of complex systems (like Class IV ECAs) when properly pre-trained. This creates an "intelligent" encoder with a strong inductive bias for rule-finding, which is essential for overcoming the noise of the ADIA data where naive models failed. |
| **3. Select a Bi-directional GRU for the Symbolic Encoder** | **Winner of an Empirical Bake-Off:** In a head-to-head pre-training competition on the ECA rule-inference task, the **Bi-GRU was both more accurate (90% vs. 84%) and dramatically more efficient (22s vs. 11s per epoch for Uni-GRU)** than a Unidirectional GRU. It also outperformed a Transformer baseline, making it the clear, data-driven choice. |
| **4. Select a `TSEncoder` for the Latent Encoder** | **Proven for Rich Representations:** The TS2Vec paper demonstrated that its encoder architecture excels at creating robust, multi-scale "fingerprint" embeddings suitable for a variety of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection. It is a purpose-built tool for this role. |
| **5. Empirically Tune Symbolizer Parameters to `d=6, τ=10`** | **Data-Driven Configuration:** A systematic test harness using Jensen-Shannon Divergence was run on the actual ADIA data. The resulting heatmap showed an **unambiguous peak in signal sensitivity at a permutation dimension of `d=6` and lag of `τ=10`**. This decision is grounded in a direct analysis of the target dataset's properties. |
| **6. Fine-Tune by Freezing Encoders** | **Efficient Knowledge Transfer:** To prevent the pre-trained "expert" knowledge from being destroyed by exposure to the noisy ADIA data, we will freeze the weights of both encoders. We will train **only the final, lightweight classifier head**, which learns to interpret the divergence signals from the two experts. |
| **7. Use a Weighted Loss Function** | **Handle Class Imbalance:** EDA showed a 71/29 class imbalance. A weighted `BCEWithLogitsLoss` is necessary to prevent the model from becoming biased towards the majority "no-break" class and to ensure it learns to correctly identify the rare "break" events. |
