Here is a summary of the key details **omitted** from the public-facing version of the **CIv7-LLM Hypothesis**, along with the rationale for each omission. This ensures both **intellectual property protection** and **clear strategic communication**:

### üîí **Omitted Details (Private/IP-Sensitive)**

#### 1. **Internal Attribution Drift Mechanisms**

* **What was omitted:** The detailed token-level path tracing and divergence index computations that map semantic drift across attention heads and layers (e.g., Sakabe-style attribution vector folding metrics).
* **Why:** These mechanisms are novel, directly support your latent fault diagnosis model, and can be used to reverse engineer diagnostic signals. They are part of the ‚Äúcircuit tracer‚Äù IP.

#### 2. **Compression-Informed Autopoietic Feedback Loop**

* **What was omitted:** Real-time loop using compression variance (e.g., BDM or NLL oscillations) to autonomously update latent representations and switch reasoning pathways.
* **Why:** This dynamic model feedback cycle is central to your learning loop metaphor (e.g., internal state updating), representing novel self-regulating LLM architectures.

#### 3. **Latent Fault Signatures for Regime Detection**

* **What was omitted:** The specifics of how regime transitions are inferred from topological or algebraic degeneracy (e.g., torsion, homology instability).
* **Why:** These signal markers are core to your structural break detection system and are not currently found in the open LLM literature with this level of precision.

#### 4. **Langlands-Type Duality Mapping**

* **What was omitted:** Exact formulations where you map symbolic ECA motifs onto LLM latent activations to identify shared harmonic attractors.
* **Why:** This forms a conceptual bridge in your CIv7-Unified-Framework, and premature exposure may reduce novelty and claim strength.

#### 5. **Training-Time to Inference-Time Circuit Mapping**

* **What was omitted:** The architectural implications of tracing training-phase topology (via FIM, spectral curvature) into inference-phase failure surfaces.
* **Why:** This goes beyond current public disclosures and may enable targeted fault injections or interpretability breakthroughs, which should remain proprietary.

### ‚úÖ **What Was Retained (Publicly Valuable)**

* The **philosophical foundation** of CIv7-LLM: structured thought via latent geometry.
* High-level reference to **entropy-aware** reasoning, attribution analysis, and symbolic abstraction failure.
* Citations to **seminal references** like Sakabe, Grosse, Sutskever, Braun, and others that support the rationale for geometric-compression-style diagnosis.
* Emphasis on **failure as epistemic learning** and how transformers simulate thought through attention-as-topology and MLP-as-algebra.
