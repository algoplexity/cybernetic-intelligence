✅ The CIv7 Unified Framework Hypothesis (Public Version) has been updated.

Key omissions from the private/internal version include:

* ✂️ Omitted:

  * Detailed mechanisms of attribution path tracing across symbolic-geometric layers
  * Dynamic motif selection based on entropy feedback and compression anomalies
  * Specific architectural bridges for projecting ECA motifs into LLM latent space (e.g., Langlands duality mappings, motif injectors)
  * Mechanisms for self-adaptive motif reconfiguration during feedback-triggered learning loops

* ✅ Retained:

  * High-level architectural roles of ECA and LLM components
  * The conceptual cybernetic loop of compression and feedback
  * Applications to structural break detection, synthetic data, and thematic modeling

Let me know if you’d like a teaser post or a formatted version for publication.
