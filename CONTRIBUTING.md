# Contributing to Cybernetic Intelligence

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Cybernetic Intelligence** project. This is an open research and development initiative focused on exploring viable, scalable human+AI teaming through cybernetic systems.

We welcome contributions in the form of:

## 💡 Conceptual Contributions
- Feedback or extensions to the core hypothesis
- Alternative theoretical framings (e.g., observer theory, autopoiesis, abstraction gaps)
- Comparative studies or critiques of LLMs and emergent models

## 🧠 Research and Experiments
- Empirical validation of recursive refinement mechanisms
- Prototyping ecosystems of specialized LLMs or rule-based agents
- Structured representations (e.g., knowledge graphs) or semantic routing strategies

## 💻 Code and Infrastructure
- Runtime platforms for multi-agent LLM orchestration
- Implementations of emergent models (e.g., cellular automata)
- Visualization tools or dashboards for human-AI feedback loops

## 📄 Markdown Documentation
- Improving existing docs inside `/docs`
- Suggesting new pages or simplifications
- Linking relevant research or citations

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your contribution
3. Commit your changes and open a pull request
4. Use clear commit messages and reference related articles if applicable

---

## 🌱 Guidelines
- Keep theory pieces well-cited
- When in doubt, open a GitHub Issue to propose an idea before implementation
- This is a collaborative project — we value humility, curiosity, and systems thinking

---

Looking forward to building viable AI ecosystems together!
