## Proposal: Building a Cybernetic Sensor for Modern Slavery Act Compliance

### Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the development of a **Cybernetic Sensor**—an intelligent socio-technical system that continuously monitors, analyses, and interprets corporate compliance disclosures under the Modern Slavery Act.
The system builds on the open-source **Project AIMS (AI against Modern Slavery)** repository as its technical foundation. By layering automated sensing, adaptive feedback, and policy integration, the sensor converts the national Modern Slavery Statements Register into a live, self-correcting governance instrument.

### 1. Background

Regulators currently rely on manual assessment of thousands of corporate statements. This approach is slow, fragmented, and reactive.
Project AIMS already automates part of the process: extracting text, applying natural language processing, and classifying statements against defined compliance metrics. However, it functions as a static analytical tool, not as a live, learning system.
The proposed Cybernetic Sensor extends AIMS into a continuously adaptive system that identifies compliance risks, measures systemic trends, and learns from its own feedback.

### 2. Concept Overview

A **Cybernetic Sensor** is a self-updating governance mechanism that observes, analyses, and responds to its environment through feedback.
Applied to Modern Slavery compliance, it functions as a **closed-loop intelligence system** linking:

* **Sensing:** automated extraction and analysis of company statements.
* **Interpretation:** machine learning models assessing compliance quality and thematic coherence.
* **Feedback:** real-time dashboards and alerts that inform regulators, industry bodies, and policymakers.
* **Adaptation:** model retraining and rule updates based on new filings and outcomes.

This architecture transforms compliance oversight from periodic audits into continuous system-level monitoring.

### 3. Layered Architecture

**Layer 1: Data and Perception**
Automated data ingestion from the Modern Slavery Register, corporate websites, and other public sources.
Includes OCR, text extraction, and normalization pipelines to convert unstructured PDFs into structured, machine-readable datasets.

**Layer 2: Analysis and Classification**
Machine learning models evaluate disclosures against statutory indicators—governance, due diligence, remediation, risk assessment, and effectiveness.
Classification scores generate a compliance vector for each company.

**Layer 3: Aggregation and Pattern Detection**
Aggregated results reveal sectoral and regional compliance patterns.
Time-series analysis detects “structural breaks”—sudden shifts suggesting strategic concealment, data manipulation, or emerging risk.

**Layer 4: Feedback and Policy Interface**
Interactive dashboards present live system states.
Regulators receive alerts when compliance patterns deviate significantly from baselines.
This feedback loop allows policy calibration and targeted interventions.

**Layer 5: Reflexive Learning and Governance**
The sensor monitors its own accuracy and bias, continuously adjusting model parameters and thresholds.
Ethical oversight and explainable-AI methods ensure transparency, fairness, and accountability.

### 4. Expected Benefits to the Regulator

**Operational:**

* Automated assessment of all statements in real time.
* Detection of non-compliance without manual triage.
* Substantial reduction in review costs and time.

**Systemic:**

* Continuous visibility into national compliance health.
* Early detection of emerging risks and behavioral drift.
* Evidence-based prioritization of audits and policy updates.

**Strategic:**

* Quantitative insight into how corporate behavior adapts to regulation.
* Foundation for cross-domain policy analysis (environmental, governance, labor).
* Public transparency infrastructure reinforcing trust and accountability.

### 5. Broader Impact

The Cybernetic Sensor establishes a model for **adaptive regulation**—a governance system that learns from data, updates its models, and guides institutional behavior through feedback rather than periodic enforcement.
The same architecture can be extended to other domains such as ESG reporting, climate disclosures, or financial risk transparency.

### 6. Implementation Outlook

This project begins with the existing AIMS codebase, expands its scope, and embeds feedback mechanisms.
It provides a practical, research-aligned foundation for collaborative development with universities, regulators, and industry partners.

---

**Summary Statement**
Transforming the Modern Slavery Register into a Cybernetic Sensor converts compliance monitoring from a static repository into a living intelligence system. It enables regulators to sense, understand, and steer systemic behavior with unprecedented precision, creating the first prototype of data-driven, adaptive governance.
