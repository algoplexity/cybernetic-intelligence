Executive Summary 
This proposal seeks collaboration with DEBI and BAGE to support a data analytics project aimed at improving compliance and systemic risk management under section 16 (s16) of the Modern Slavery Act.
Key objectives include identifying repeat non-compliance patterns, systemic risk factors, and non-lodgement behaviours through advanced data analysis. The project will develop risk models, dashboards, and automated workflows, while ensuring strong data governance and security. 
Deliverables:
•	Structured and integrated datasets
•	Risk analytics models and cohort analysis tools
•	Interactive dashboards and visual reports
•	End-to-end data pipelines from the Register ensuring reliable data extraction, transformation, and loading
•	Automated data processing workflows
•	Training and knowledge transfer materials

Objectives
The proposed collaboration will support the following objectives, enabled by effective data pipeline design and management:
•	Identify repeat non-compliance at individual and cohort levels, supported by timely, high-quality data flows from the Register.
•	Detect systemic risk factors correlated with repeat non-compliance and non-resubmission behaviours, leveraging integrated data streams.
•	Analyse non-lodgement patterns to detect late or unidentified lodgers through cross-referencing data collected via automated pipelines.
•	Conduct systemic risk analytics informed by continuously updated and validated datasets.
•	Develop predictive risk models supported by reliable, up-to-date data ingestion processes.
•	Automate data workflows and streamline extraction of unstructured data sources within the pipelines.
•	Design and implement dashboards and visualisations fed by real-time or regularly updated data.
•	Identify gaps in existing data collection and recommend improvements to data pipeline processes.
•	Ensure data management and security within pipelines align with best practices and APS data handling standards.
•	Build internal capability by transferring knowledge on pipeline operation and maintenance along with analytics.

Scope of Work
Components of the data pipelines:
•	Extraction and Structuring: Assist with extracting and structuring data from unstructured sources, integrated into scalable data pipelines.
•	Integration: Support linking and matching datasets via pipelines to ensure consistent, accessible data for analytics.
Analytics and Modelling
•	Risk Factor Analysis: Use data ingested through pipelines to identify systemic risk factors.
•	Model Development: Support the development of models that rely on data maintained by pipelines.
Visualisation and Automation
•	Dashboard Development: Design dashboards pulling from pipeline-fed datasets.
•	Workflow Automation: Develop automation within pipelines to streamline data processing and reporting.
Governance and Capability Building
•	Data Governance: Advise on governance practices specifically around pipeline data security and privacy.
•	Training and Support: Train staff on pipeline usage and integration with analytics tools.

Deliverables
The project is expected to produce the following deliverables with an emphasis on the data pipelines:
•	Structured datasets integrating compliance, tax, and financial information sourced through pipelines
•	Analytical reports generated from pipeline-maintained data identifying repeat non-compliance and systemic risks
•	Predictive risk models and cohort identification tools fed by continuous data flows
•	End-to-end data pipelines from the Register, ensuring reliable, scalable, and automated extraction, transformation, and loading of data into analytics and reporting systems
•	Interactive dashboards and visualisation assets based on pipeline-updated data
•	Automated data workflows and supporting documentation on pipeline operation
•	Training sessions and support materials covering pipeline management and analytics use
