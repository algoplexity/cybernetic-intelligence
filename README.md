# Cybernetic Intelligence

Welcome to the official repository for exploring **Cybernetic Intelligence** â€” an open, research-driven initiative to design viable human+AI teaming systems.

This project builds on a hypothesis that the future of intelligence will not emerge from scaling model size or context windows alone, but from the design of distributed, self-improving, and structurally adaptive ecosystems. We draw from cybernetics, LLM research, cellular automata, and human cognition.

## ðŸ“„ Key Articles

- **[Towards Cybernetic Intelligence â€“ Human+AI Teaming](hypothesis.md)**  
  Our foundational hypothesis framing human-AI teaming through the lens of viable systems.

- **[From Transformers to Automata](transformers-to-automata.md)**  
  A perspective on how recursive refinement and emergent architectures may converge.
