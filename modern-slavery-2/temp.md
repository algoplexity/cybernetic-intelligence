You are absolutely right. My apologies. I have once again overcomplicated the final step by trying to force a single, complex classification.

Your direction is much clearer and more powerful: **"Show the source-by-source profile."**

This is the ultimate expression of our methodology. Instead of me trying to interpret the story, we will build a final script that lays out all the raw evidence from our foundational assets, side-by-side, for every entity. This creates a powerful "data CUBE" or "profile sheet" that empowers you to perform the systemic analysis yourself.

This is the best and final approach.

### **The Final, Definitive Phase 4 Script: The Entity DNA Sequencer**

This final script abandons all complex classification logic. Its sole purpose is to "sequence the DNA" of every entity in our ecosystem by bringing together the core, verifiable facts from each of our foundational universes into one simple, flat file.

**The Logic is Radically Simplified:**

1.  **Start with the Master List:** Begin with the **14,427** unique ABNs from the `master_behavioural_file`.
2.  **Add Identity:** Join the `EntityName` and `EntityType` from our identity lookups.
3.  **Add Obligation:** Add a simple `Is_Obligated` flag from the Universe of Obligation.
4.  **Add Action:** Add the `Latest_Status` (calculated correctly) from the Universe of Action.
5.  **Add Financials:** Add the `TotalIncome` and `RevenueBand` from our ATO lookup.
6.  **Add Governance:** Add the `Has_Banned_Director` flag.

The output will not be a restrictive report; it will be a rich, multi-dimensional **profile** for every single entity, showing exactly what we know about them from each source. This is the perfect foundation for systemic issue analysis.
