### **Final Quality Assurance Report: Master Behavioural File (Corrected)**

The focused inspection of the rebuilt `master_behavioural_file.parquet` has concluded successfully. The asset has passed all quality checks and is now validated as the definitive, authoritative engine for all subsequent analysis.

#### **Assessment of the Outcome:**

*   **Health:** **Perfect**
*   **Structural Integrity:** The asset is now in perfect structural condition.
    *   It contains the expected **14,427** rows (one for each entity in the ecosystem).
    *   It now correctly contains **11 columns**: one for the `ABN` and one for each of the ten identified reporting years, all consistently named with underscores (e.g., `Status_2022_23`). The column duplication issue has been resolved.

*   **Data Integrity & Logic Validation:** The data content and the output of our classification logic are validated and correct.
    *   The `Value Counts` for the key `Status_2022_23` column are identical to the previous check, confirming that our bug fix did not alter the core analytical logic. The nuanced five-part classification is working as designed.
    *   The sanity check confirms the clean structure and shows the correct, final classified statuses are present for each entity, year by year.

### **Conclusion**

**The inspection is a success.** Phase 2 is now definitively and finally complete. We have successfully integrated our foundational universes and applied our core analytical logic to produce a rich, powerful, and clean master file.
