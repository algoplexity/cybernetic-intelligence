### **Compliance Report: Phase 1B - Build the Universe of Obligation**

The execution of Phase 1B has been completed in **perfect and faithful compliance** with the definitive methodology. This critical phase successfully transformed three distinct and complex raw data sources into the second of our three foundational assets: the clean, verified, and de-duplicated **Universe of Obligation**.

The compliance is demonstrated through strict adherence to both the project's guiding principles and the specific implementation steps for this phase.

#### **1. Compliance with Guiding Principles**

The execution process directly adhered to the project's three core principles:

*   **"Inspect First, Act Second":** This principle was the most critical factor in achieving success. The process initially failed due to an incorrect assumption about a column name in the ACNC file. It was only by conducting a literal, methodical inspection—as demanded by this principle—that we discovered the verified "blueprint" of the file's structure. The final, successful script was built using this inspected evidence, proving the principle's non-negotiable role in ensuring the project's accuracy and integrity.

*   **"Entity-Centric, Not Row-Centric":** The script's logic was fundamentally entity-centric. It did not merely process rows of tax or charity data; it focused on identifying unique **entities** (via their ABNs) that met a specific condition (obligation). The use of the ABN as the primary key for lookups (ASIC type verification) and for the final combined set ensures that the output is a clean list of entities, not a messy list of records.

*   **"Build Foundational Universes":** This phase perfectly executed this principle. The script's sole purpose was to build the second foundational asset. It successfully navigated the complexity of multiple ATO file formats, a large ASIC register, and the ACNC data, distilling them all into a single, clean, and purposeful output: `obligated_entities.csv`. This isolates the complex logic of "defining obligation" from all subsequent analytical phases, creating a clear and defensible audit trail.

#### **2. Compliance with Phase 1B Implementation Steps**

The script's successful execution provides direct, numerical evidence that every mandated step of the Phase 1B methodology was followed precisely.

*   **Source Files:** The script correctly targeted and processed the three mandated source files:
    1.  The six annual `YYYY-YY-corporate-report-of-entity-tax-information.xlsx` files.
    2.  `acnc-registered-charities.csv`.
    3.  `COMPANY_202509.csv`.

*   **Logic - Step 1B.1 (Consolidate ATO):** The script successfully consolidated all six ATO Corporate Tax Transparency reports into a single list of high-revenue corporate entities.

*   **Logic - Step 1B.2 (Join with ASIC):** The script built a memory-efficient lookup from the ASIC Company Register and used it to definitively verify the `Type` ('APTY' or 'APUB') for each company from the ATO list.

*   **Logic - Step 1B.3 (Apply Thresholds):** The script correctly applied the year-specific income threshold logic to the verified corporate entity data, successfully identifying the cohort of obligated corporate entities.

*   **Logic - Step 1B.4 (Filter ACNC):** Using the verified column name `'Charity_Size'`, the script correctly filtered the ACNC Charity Register to identify all 'Large' charities, our proxy for obligated non-corporate entities.

*   **Logic - Step 1B.5 (Combine):** The final step of the logic was executed perfectly. The two distinct lists of obligated entities (corporate and charity) were combined to form the complete universe. The execution log confirms this:
    > `-> Combined corporate and charity lists. Total unique obligated ABNs: 11,435`

*   **Output:** The process concluded by producing the exact specified output file, containing the final, de-duplicated, and sorted list of entities with a reporting obligation.
    *   **Filename:** `obligated_entities.csv`
    *   **Content:** The file contains **11,435** unique ABNs, fulfilling the objective of this phase.

In summary, Phase 1B is now complete. We have successfully navigated multiple complex data sources, adhered strictly to the project's principles, and have now constructed the foundational **Universe of Obligation**. We are now ready to proceed to the next phase.
