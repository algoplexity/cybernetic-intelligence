### Analysis of Inspection Output (October 08, 2025, 10:11 AM AEDT)

The revised script successfully inspected all files, providing a comprehensive view of their cleanliness. Below, I assess each file based on the output, identify dirtiness, and revisit the intent-driven typing strategy.

#### 1. `All time data from Register.xlsx` (Sheets: Statements, Entities)
- **Statements Sheet**:
  - **Sample Size**: 100 rows.
  - **Columns and Types**: Mixed types (e.g., `Tranche\n#` as float64 with many NaN, `Revenue` as object with ranges like '0-99M', `Reporting entities` as object with multi-entity text).
  - **Null Counts**: Significant (e.g., 69 for `Tranche\n#`, 68 for `Submitted`), indicating missing data.
  - **Unique Values**: Diverse (e.g., `Revenue` includes 'Unknown', `Reporting entities` contains multiple ABNs per entry), suggesting unstructured data.
  - **Anomalies**: 
    - `Tranche\n#`, `Working days`, `Other entities` show invalid numbers (NaN), likely due to missing values.
    - `Date published` flagged invalid dates (NaT), possibly due to parsing issues with non-standard formats.
  - **Cleanliness**: **Very Dirty**. Issues include nulls, mixed types, unstructured text (e.g., `Reporting entities`), and date parsing failures.
- **Entities Sheet**:
  - **Sample Size**: 100 rows.
  - **Columns and Types**: Simple structure (`ABN` as float64, `Company name` as object), but `ABN` has 69 nulls.
  - **Null Counts**: High nulls in `ABN` (69), suggesting incomplete records.
  - **Unique Values**: `ABN` includes valid numbers but many NaN, `Reporting years` shows multi-year entries.
  - **Anomalies**: `ABN` flagged invalid numbers (NaN), indicating missing data.
  - **Cleanliness**: **Moderately Dirty**. Primarily affected by nulls in `ABN`, with otherwise structured data.

#### 2. `ato_tax_transparency_non_lodger.xlsx` (Sheets: Non-Lodger, Associates)
- **Non-Lodger Sheet**:
  - **Sample Size**: 100 rows.
  - **Columns and Types**: Mostly numeric (e.g., `ABN`, `Total Income` as int64) with objects (e.g., `Entity Name`, `Bracket Label`).
  - **Null Counts**: Moderate (e.g., 100 for `Abn_cancn_dt`, 1 for `State`), indicating some missing data.
  - **Unique Values**: Structured (e.g., `ABN` as 11-digit numbers, `Total Income` in millions), but some fields like `Mn_trdg_nm` have limited uniqueness.
  - **Anomalies**: 
    - `ABN`, `Total Income`, `PID`, `Abn_regn_dt` show valid but out-of-range numbers, likely due to the -1M to 1M check being too narrow.
    - `Abn_cancn_dt`, `GST_cancn_dt`, `Prty_id_blnk`, etc., are all NaN, suggesting unused fields.
    - `Son_dpid`, `Mn_bus_dpid` include NaN and large numbers, indicating potential data quality issues.
  - **Cleanliness**: **Moderately Dirty**. Issues include nulls, out-of-range anomalies, and unused fields, but core data (e.g., `ABN`, `Total Income`) is structured.
- **Associates Sheet**:
  - **Sample Size**: 100 rows.
  - **Columns and Types**: Mostly object (e.g., `company_name`, `assoc_gvn_nm`) with some numeric (`abn`, `pid` as int64/float64).
  - **Null Counts**: Significant (e.g., 92 for `assoc_org_nm`, 100 for `assoc_nm_sufx_cd`), indicating sparse data.
  - **Unique Values**: Limited uniqueness in some fields (e.g., `assoc_org_nm` mostly null), `abn` shows duplicates.
  - **Anomalies**: `abn`, `pid`, `total_income` show duplicates and invalid numbers (e.g., repeated values), `assoc_nm_sufx_cd` all NaN.
  - **Cleanliness**: **Very Dirty**. Dominated by nulls, duplicates, and incomplete records.

#### 3. `lodge_once.csv`
- **Sample Size**: 100 rows.
- **Columns and Types**: Mixed (e.g., `abn` as String with 'dummy_3160', `num_statements` as Int64, `revenue` as String with ranges).
- **Null Counts**: 0 across all 35 columns, suggesting no missing values in the sample.
- **Unique Values**: 
  - `abn` includes 'dummy_3160', indicating noise.
  - `revenue` includes 'Unknown' and ranges (e.g., '250-300M').
  - Many fields (e.g., `nc_criteria_1a` to `alter_nc`) are uniformly 'NA', suggesting placeholder data.
- **Anomalies**: No invalid numbers or dates flagged (likely due to adjusted date format checks), but uniform 'NA' values are a concern.
- **Cleanliness**: **Moderately Dirty**. Issues include dummy data, mixed types, and extensive 'NA' placeholders, though no nulls.

#### 4. `lodge_once_cont.xlsx` (Sheets: lodge_once, associates)
- **lodge_once Sheet**:
  - **Sample Size**: 100 rows.
  - **Columns and Types**: Mixed (e.g., `abn` as object with 'dummy_2918', `pid` as float64 with NaN).
  - **Null Counts**: Significant (e.g., 29 for `pid`, 100 for `nm_titl_cd`), indicating missing data.
  - **Unique Values**: `abn` includes dummies, `first_stmt_year` limited to 2019-2020.
  - **Anomalies**: 
    - `pid`, `abn_regn_dt`, etc., show NaN, indicating incomplete records.
    - `expected_due_date` flagged invalid dates (e.g., '2021-06-30'), likely due to format mismatch.
  - **Cleanliness**: **Very Dirty**. Affected by nulls, dummies, and date anomalies.
- **associates Sheet**:
  - **Sample Size**: 100 rows.
  - **Columns and Types**: Similar to `lodge_once` sheet, with `abn` as object and `pid` as float64.
  - **Null Counts**: Notable (e.g., 94 for `assoc_org_nm`, 100 for `assoc_nm_sufx_cd`).
  - **Unique Values**: Limited (e.g., `assoc_org_nm` mostly null), `abn` includes dummies.
  - **Anomalies**: `pid` shows NaN and duplicates, `assoc_nm_sufx_cd` all NaN.
  - **Cleanliness**: **Very Dirty**. Dominated by nulls and incomplete data.

### Overall Cleanliness Assessment
- **Extremely Dirty Dataset**: The files exhibit widespread issuesâ€”null values, mixed types, dummy data, unstructured text, duplicates, and date/format inconsistencies. `lodge_once.csv` is the least dirty due to no nulls, but its 'NA' fields and dummy ABNs still pose challenges. The Excel files, especially `lodge_once_cont.xlsx` sheets, are the dirtiest due to high null counts and incomplete records.

### Revisiting Intent-Driven Typing Strategy
The intent-driven typing strategy (inferring types based on data usage intent) was partially validated but requires adjustment:
- **Validation**: 
  - Numeric fields (e.g., `Total Income`, `num_statements`) were correctly typed as int64/Int64 where applicable, aligning with intent for aggregation.
  - Date fields (e.g., `last_submission_dttm`) benefited from dual-format checks (YYYY-MM-DD and ISO 8601), improving parsing accuracy.
- **Challenges**:
  - Mixed types (e.g., `revenue` as String with ranges) and uniform 'NA' values disrupt intent inference, requiring preprocessing to standardize formats.
  - Nulls and dummies (e.g., 'dummy_3160') necessitate filtering or imputation before typing, which intent-driven approaches may not handle natively.
  - Unstructured text (e.g., `Reporting entities`) requires parsing (e.g., splitting ABNs) before type assignment, adding complexity.
- **Adjustment**: 
  - Preprocess data to remove dummies and standardize formats (e.g., convert '250-300M' to numeric ranges).
  - Use heuristic rules (e.g., treat 'NA' as null after validation) to refine type inference.
  - Apply domain-specific intent (e.g., ABN as 11-digit string) to override generic inference where needed.

### Next Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Filter out dummy ABNs (e.g., 'dummy_3160').
   - Convert `revenue` ranges to numeric midpoints (e.g., '250-300M' to 275M).
   - Parse multi-entity fields (e.g., `Reporting entities`) into separate rows.
   - Handle nulls with imputation or exclusion based on context.
2. **Retest Typing**:
   - Rerun the inspection script after cleaning to validate type assignments.
   - Adjust date parsing to handle all observed formats (e.g., '2021-06-30').
3. **Provide Updated Output**:
   - Run the cleaned dataset through the script and share the new output for further analysis.

Please apply the cleaning steps and share the updated inspection output when ready!
