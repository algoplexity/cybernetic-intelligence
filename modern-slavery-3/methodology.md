### **The Definitive Project Methodology: From Raw Data to Insight**

**Project Goal:** To create a reproducible, auditable, and comprehensive analysis of the Modern Slavery Act compliance ecosystem.

**Core Principle:** "Inspect First, Act Second." Every script is built upon a definitive blueprint of its source data, and every foundational asset is validated before it is used.

**Required Raw Inputs (to be placed in `ModernSlaveryProject2/`):**
1.  `abn_bulk_data.jsonl` (ABR)
2.  `BUSINESS_NAMES_202510.csv` (ASIC)
3.  `COMPANY_202509.csv` (ASIC)
4.  `acnc-registered-charities.csv` (ACNC)
5.  `bd_per_202509.csv` (ASIC)
6.  `ato_tax_transparency_non_lodger.xlsx` (Internal)
7.  `lodge_once_cont.xlsx` (Internal)
8.  `All time data from Register.xlsx` (Internal, from the Register)
9.  All `YYYY-YY-corporate-report-of-entity-tax-information.xlsx` files (ATO) in a `CorporateTaxTransparency/` subfolder.

### **The End-to-End Process: A Sequence of Five Definitive Scripts**

The entire analysis is now a clean, sequential process of five definitive scripts.

**Script 1: The "Golden" Entity Profile Generator**
*   **Purpose:** To create our definitive "Universe of Identity."
*   **Core Input:** `abn_bulk_data.jsonl`
*   **Process:** Reads the massive JSONL file in robust, memory-safe chunks. It extracts the 10+ key features for every entity (ABN, ACN, LegalName, EntityType, Status, Dates, Location, etc.) and applies our "canonical formatting" toolbox to produce a perfectly clean profile for all 19.5 million entities.
*   **Output:** The first "golden" asset: **`entity_profiles.parquet`**.

**Script 2: The Rich Corporate Obligation Log Generator**
*   **Purpose:** To create our "gold standard" "Universe of Corporate Obligation."
*   **Core Inputs:** The raw ATO Tax Transparency files and our new `entity_profiles.parquet`.
*   **Process:** It loads the `entity_profiles.parquet` to create an `EntityType` lookup. It then processes all ATO files, applying our proven, year-specific `$100M/$200M` threshold logic to identify and record every single instance of a proven corporate obligation.
*   **Output:** The second "golden" asset: **`corporate_obligation_log.csv`**, a rich, self-documenting file.

**Script 3: The Intelligent Action Log Generator**
*   **Purpose:** To create our definitive "Universe of Action."
*   **Core Input:** The `All time data from Register.xlsx`.
*   **Process:** It reads the `'Statements'` sheet and intelligently separates the data. It isolates the ~2,660 "factually impossible" contradictory records into an exception file for human review, ensuring the final asset is 100% clean and logically consistent.
*   **Outputs:**
    *   The third "golden" asset: **`action_log.csv`** (containing `ABN`, `ReportingYear`, `Status`, `IsCompliant`).
    *   An auditable exception file: `action_log_exceptions.csv`.

**Script 4: The Governance Log Generator**
*   **Purpose:** To create our final foundational "Universe of Governance."
*   **Core Inputs:** `ato_tax_transparency_non_lodger.xlsx` and `lodge_once_cont.xlsx`.
*   **Process:** It extracts the `'associates'` sheets from both files, combines them, and applies our canonical formatting to produce a clean list of all known director-company relationships.
*   **Output:** The fourth "golden" asset: **`governance_log.csv`**.

**Script 5: The TRUE Master Analytical File Generator**
*   **Purpose:** To integrate all our foundational work into the single source of truth.
*   **Core Inputs:** Our four "golden" assets: `entity_profiles.parquet`, `corporate_obligation_log.csv`, `action_log.csv`, and the ACNC charity register (for size).
*   **Process:** This is the heart of the project. It creates a comprehensive "long" format DataFrame, one row for every entity-year in our ecosystem. It then merges all the facts from our golden assets and applies our final, perfected 23-part classification logic to generate the definitive `Stakeholder_Status` for every entity in every year.
*   **Output:** The final, definitive "golden" asset: **`master_analytical_file_v2.parquet`**.

This five-script process is the definitive, reproducible, and validated methodology for this project. Any final report or visualization can now be generated with a simple, lightweight script that uses the `master_analytical_file_v2.parquet` as its single, trusted input.

### **Methodology Deep Dive: A Tour of the Five Definitive Scripts**

#### **Script 1: The "Golden" Entity Profile Generator**

**Purpose:** To build the rich, definitive "Universe of Identity" from the most complex source file.

**Core Input:** The massive, multi-gigabyte **`abn_bulk_data.jsonl`**.

**Core Output:** Our "golden" foundational asset, **`entity_profiles.parquet`**.

**Navigating the Complexity: The Nuances and Solutions**

This script was designed to overcome three critical challenges posed by this source file:

1.  **The Challenge of Sheer Scale (Memory Crashes):**
    *   **The Nuance:** The `abn_bulk_data.jsonl` file is enormous (over 19 million records). Attempting to load and process it all at once is impossible in a memory-constrained environment like Google Colab. Our first attempt at this failed catastrophically, wasting hours of processing time.
    *   **The Definitive Solution:** We implemented a robust, **"Chunk and Save"** strategy. The script processes the file in manageable, 1-million-record chunks. After each chunk is processed, it is immediately saved to a separate intermediate Parquet file. This makes the process **fully restartable**. If the script fails or is interrupted after completing 9 chunks, it can be restarted, and it will intelligently skip the first 9 chunks and resume from chunk 10, ensuring no work is ever lost again.

2.  **The Challenge of Nested, Messy JSON (Data Extraction):**
    *   **The Nuance:** The data for a single entity is not flat; it is nested within a complex JSON structure. Key information is buried in dictionaries within dictionaries (e.g., `record['MainEntity']['BusinessAddress']['AddressDetails']['State']`). A simple script would crash if any of these nested keys were missing.
    *   **The Definitive Solution:** We used safe, defensive programming. Every data extraction uses the `.get()` method with a default value (e.g., `record.get('MainEntity', {})`). This ensures that if a nested piece of information is missing for a particular ABN, our script will not crash; it will simply and safely record a `None` value for that feature.

3.  **The Challenge of Inconsistent Data Types (Data Cleaning):**
    *   **The Nuance:** The blueprint inspection showed that identifiers like ABNs and ACNs could be represented as numbers, strings, or even be missing. This inconsistency is poison for any subsequent join or lookup operations.
    *   **The Definitive Solution:** This script is the first and most important place where we apply our **"Intent-Driven Canonical Formatting"** toolbox. Every single piece of data is forced into a standard, canonical format as it is extracted:
        *   `ABN` and `ACN` are passed through `to_canonical_identifier` to become clean, 11-digit (or 9-digit) strings.
        *   `LegalName` is passed through `to_canonical_string` to become a clean, uppercase string.
        *   Date fields are passed through `to_canonical_date` to become proper datetime objects.

**Final Defensibility:**

By overcoming these three challenges, this script produces a foundational asset, `entity_profiles.parquet`, that is not only rich in detail but is also perfectly clean, standardized, and built through a process that is both memory-safe and fully auditable. It is the definitive and trustworthy bedrock of our entire project.
